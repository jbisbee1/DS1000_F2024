# Agenda

1. Why did the polls underestimate Trump support?

2. Rules of visualization


---

# 2020 polling

--

- Let's introduce a different dataset!

--

  - Download and open [`Pres2020_PV.Rds`](https://github.com/jbisbee1/DS1000_F2024/blob/main/data/Pres2020_PV.Rds)
  - Wrangle to get the popular vote margin, expressed in decimals
  
--

```{r,message=F,warning=F}
require(tidyverse)
poll <- read_rds('https://github.com/jbisbee1/DS1000_S2024/raw/main/data/Pres2020_PV.Rds')

poll <- poll %>%
  mutate(Trump = Trump/100,
         Biden = Biden/100,
         margin = Biden - Trump)
```

---

# The Research Question

```{r}
pRQ <- poll %>%
  ggplot() + 
  geom_bar(aes(x = Biden*100),fill = 'blue',alpha = .5) + 
  geom_bar(aes(x = Trump*100),fill = 'red',alpha = .5) + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = 47,linetype = 'dashed',color= 'red') + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = 51,linetype = 'dashed',color= 'blue')+ 
  annotate(geom = 'text',x = c(47),y = Inf,angle = 90,hjust = 1,vjust = 0,label = c("Trump's Actual Support"),color = 'darkred') + 
  annotate(geom = 'text',x = c(51),y = Inf,angle = 90,hjust = 1,vjust = 1,label = c("Biden's Actual Support"),color = 'darkblue') + 
  labs(title = 'Poll Bias in the 2020 U.S. Presidential Election',
       subtitle = 'Predicted vs Actual Support for Trump (red) and Biden (blue)',

# The Research Question

```{r}
poll %>% # Proportion that under-predict
  summarise(propBidenUP = mean(Biden < .51),
            propTrumpUP = mean(Trump < .47))
```
--

```{r}

# .blue[Theorizing]

--

- .blue[Research Question]: Why do polls under-predict Trump more than Biden?

--

  1. Unrepresentative samples (how were respondents contacted?)
  
  2. Small samples (how many respondents?)
  
  3. Shy Trump Voters / trolls (lying respondents)
  
  4. Timing (closer to the election &rarr; less biased)

---

# .blue[Theorizing]

- A fifth explanation?

--

- Anti-Trump media!

---

# .blue[Theorizing]

--

- Theory #1: Does the "mode" of the survey matter?

--

  - I.e., if you only call people on landlines, who do you reach?
  
--

  - And how might they differ from the general population?
  
--

- .blue[Assumption 1]: Younger people do not use landlines, meaning that surveys which rely on **r**andom **d**igit **d**ialing (RDD) will get disproportionately older respondents.

--

- .blue[Assumption 2]: Younger voters are more progressive, making them less likely to support Trump.

--

- .blue[Theory]: Surveys that use RDD will find more support for Trump than Biden.

---

# .red[Analyzing]

--

- Plot the Biden-Trump vote margin by mode type

```{r}
poll %>%
  count(Mode)
```

--

- So many modes of interviewing people!

---

# (Soft) Rules of Visualization

- Variable `type` informs visualization

--

1. Univariate

  - Categorical data: `geom_bar()`
  
  - Continuous data: `geom_histogram()` or `geom_density()`
  
--

2. Bivariate

  - Categorical X Categorical: `geom_bar()`
  
  - Binary X Continuous: `geom_histogram()` or `geom_density()`
  
  - Categorical X Continuous: `geom_boxplot()` or `geom_violin()`
  
  - Continuous X Continuous: `geom_point()`
  
---

# Beyond Bivariate

2. Trivariate

  - Categorical X Categorical X Continuous: `geom_tile()`
  
  - Continuous X Continuous X Categorical: `geom_point()` + `color`
  
  - Continuous X Continuous X Continuous: `geom_point()` + `color`/`size`
  
  - Latitude X Longitude X Categorical / Continuous: Maps!
  
  - Var X Var X Time: Animated!
  
  - (Beyond the scope of this course, but get creative!)

---

# .red[Analyzing]

- For now, just focus on `IRV/Online` versus `Live phone - RDD`

--

- Since `margin` is a continuous variable, use `geom_histogram`

```{r}
pMode <- poll %>% 
  filter(Mode == "IVR/Online" | Mode == "Live phone - RDD") %>%
    ggplot(aes(x= margin, fill = Mode)) +     
  labs(y = "Number of Polls",
         x = "Biden- Trump Margin",
         title = "Biden-Trump Margin for Two Types of Polls",
        fill = "Mode of Interview") +
    geom_histogram(bins=10, color="black", position="dodge") + #<<
    scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(-.1,.2,by=.05),
                     labels= scales::percent_format(accuracy = 1))
```

---

# Mode Matters!

```{r,fig.align='center',fig.width=9,fig.height=5}
pMode
```

--

- But results are **inconsistent** with our .blue[theory]!

---

# Visualization

--

- How can we improve this? Perhaps `geom_density()` and `geom_vline()`?

```{r,fig.align='center',fig.width=9,fig.height=5}
toplot <- poll %>% 
  filter(Mode == "IVR/Online" | Mode == "Live phone - RDD")

pModeDens <- toplot %>%
  ggplot(aes(x= margin, color = Mode)) +     
  labs(y = "Number of Polls",
       x = "Biden- Trump Margin",
       title = "Biden-Trump Margin for Two Types of Polls",
       color = "Mode of Interview") +
  geom_density(lwd = 1.2) + #<<
  scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(-.1,.2,by=.05),
                     labels= scales::percent_format(accuracy = 1)) + 
  geom_vline(data = toplot %>%
               group_by(Mode) %>%
               summarise(margin = mean(margin)),aes(xintercept = margin,color = Mode),linetype = 'dashed')
```

---

# Visualization

- How can we improve this? Perhaps `geom_density()` and `geom_vline()`?

```{r,fig.align='center',fig.width=9,fig.height=5}
pModeDens
```

---

# More Modes

--

- `geom_histogram()` and `geom_density()` less useful for more comparisons

--

- First, let's drop modes that were hardly used

```{r}
(toKeep <- poll %>%
  count(Mode) %>%
  filter(n > 5, #<<
         !is.na(Mode)))

toplot <- poll %>% filter(Mode %in% toKeep$Mode)
```

---

# More Modes

- How hard is `geom_histogram()` with more categories?

```{r}
pModeHist <- toplot %>%
  ggplot(aes(x= margin, fill = Mode)) +     
  labs(y = "Number of Polls",
       x = "Biden- Trump Margin",
       title = "Biden-Trump Margin for Two Types of Polls",
       fill = "Mode of Interview") +
  geom_histogram(color = 'black',position = 'dodge',bins = 10) + #<<
  scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(-.1,.2,by=.05),
                     labels= scales::percent_format(accuracy = 1))
```

---

# More Modes

- How hard is `geom_histogram()` with more categories?

```{r,fig.align='center',fig.width=9,fig.height=5}
pModeHist
```



---

# More Modes

- How hard is `geom_density()` with more categories?

```{r}
pModeDens <- toplot %>%
  ggplot(aes(x= margin, color = Mode)) +     
  labs(y = "Number of Polls",
       x = "Biden- Trump Margin",
       title = "Biden-Trump Margin for Two Types of Polls",
       color = "Mode of Interview") +
  geom_density(lwd = 1.2) + #<<
  scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(-.1,.2,by=.05),
                     labels= scales::percent_format(accuracy = 1)) + 
  geom_vline(data = toplot %>%
               group_by(Mode) %>%
               summarise(margin = mean(margin)),aes(xintercept = margin,color = Mode),linetype = 'dashed')
```

---

# More Modes

- How hard is `geom_density()` with more categories?

```{r,fig.align='center',fig.width=9,fig.height=5}
pModeDens
```

---

# `geom_boxplot()`

--

- More categories requires more compact ways of visualizing distributions

--

```{r}
pModeBox <- toplot %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Mode, y = margin)) + 
    labs(x = "Mode of Survey Interview",
         y = "Biden- Trump Margin",
         title = "2020 Popular Vote Margin by Type of Poll") +
    geom_boxplot(fill = "slateblue") + #<<
    scale_y_continuous(breaks=seq(-.1,.2,by=.05),
                     labels= scales::percent_format(accuracy = 1))
```

---

# `geom_boxplot()`

- More categories requires more compact ways of visualizing distributions

```{r,fig.align='center',fig.width=9,fig.height=5}
pModeBox
```

---

# Ordering Unordered Categories

--

- We can use `reorder()` to arrange categories by the data

```{r}
pModeBox <- toplot %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(Mode,margin), y = margin)) + #<<
    labs(x = "Mode of Survey Interview",
         y = "Biden- Trump Margin",
         title = "2020 Popular Vote Margin by Type of Poll") +
    geom_boxplot(fill = "slateblue") + 
    scale_y_continuous(breaks=seq(-.1,.2,by=.05),
                     labels= scales::percent_format(accuracy = 1))
```

---

# Ordering Unordered Categories

- We can use `reorder()` to arrange categories by the data

```{r,fig.align='center',fig.width=9,fig.height=5}
pModeBox + coord_flip()
```

---

# `geom_violin()`

--

- Boxplots are cleaner than densities and histograms for multiple categories

--

- But we lose ability to see distributions within the 80% box

```{r}
pModeViol <- toplot %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(Mode,margin), y = margin)) + 
    labs(x = "Mode of Survey Interview",
         y = "Biden- Trump Margin",
         title = "2020 Popular Vote Margin by Type of Poll") +
    geom_violin(fill = "slateblue",alpha = .5) + #<<
    scale_y_continuous(breaks=seq(-.1,.2,by=.05),
                     labels= scales::percent_format(accuracy = 1))
```


---

# `geom_violin()`

```{r,fig.align='center',fig.width=9,fig.height=5}
pModeViol + geom_hline(yintercept = 0,linetype = 'dashed')
```

---

# Continuous by Continuous

--

- For .blue[conditional relationships] between two .red[continuous variables], use `geom_point()`

--

- .blue[Theory]: Are polls politically biased?

--

  - I.e., a Biden-friendly poll might **under**predict Trump support and **over**predict Biden support
  
--

- .red[Data]: Trump support conditional on Biden support



---

# .red[Analysis]

- Plot Trump support versus Biden support

```{r}
pSupp <- poll %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Biden, y = Trump)) + 
  labs(title="Biden and Trump Support in 2020 National Popular Vote",
       y = "Trump Support",
       x = "Biden Support") + 
  geom_point(color="purple") + 
    scale_y_continuous(breaks=seq(0,1,by=.05),
                     labels= scales::percent_format(accuracy = 1)) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(0,1,by=.05),
                     labels= scales::percent_format(accuracy = 1))
```

---

# `geom_scatter()`

```{r}
pSupp
```

--

- How many observations are at each point?

---

# Tweaking `alpha`

--

- We can set the transparency of each point such that multiple points will show up darker

--

  - I.e., `alpha=.3` means that a single point will be 70% transparent, but 3 points on top of each other will be 10% transparent

```{r}
pSupp <- poll %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Biden, y = Trump)) + 
  labs(title="Biden and Trump Support in 2020 National Popular Vote",
       y = "Trump Support",
       x = "Biden Support") + 
  geom_point(color="purple",alpha = .3,size = 3) +  #<<
    scale_y_continuous(breaks=seq(0,1,by=.05),
                     labels= scales::percent_format(accuracy = 1)) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(0,1,by=.05),
                     labels= scales::percent_format(accuracy = 1))
```

---

# Tweaking `alpha`

```{r}
pSupp
```

---

# `geom_jitter()`

--

- Instead, we could "jitter" the points

--

  - This adds some random noise to each point to shake them off each other
  
```{r}
pSupp <- poll %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Biden, y = Trump)) + 
  labs(title="Biden and Trump Support in 2020 National Popular Vote",
       y = "Trump Support",
       x = "Biden Support") + 
  geom_jitter(color="purple") +  #<<
    scale_y_continuous(breaks=seq(0,1,by=.05),
                     labels= scales::percent_format(accuracy = 1)) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(0,1,by=.05),
                     labels= scales::percent_format(accuracy = 1))
```

---

# `geom_jitter()`

```{r}
pSupp
```


---

# `size`

--

- Finally, we could simply count the number of polls at each x,y coordinate

--

  - Then size the points by the number of polls
  
```{r}
pSupp <- poll %>%
  group_by(Biden,Trump) %>%
  summarise(nPolls = n()) %>% #<<
  ggplot(aes(x = Biden, y = Trump,size = nPolls)) + #<<
  labs(title="Biden and Trump Support in 2020 National Popular Vote",
       y = "Trump Support",
       x = "Biden Support") + 
  geom_point(color="purple",alpha = .5) +  
    scale_y_continuous(breaks=seq(0,1,by=.05),
                     labels= scales::percent_format(accuracy = 1)) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(0,1,by=.05),
                     labels= scales::percent_format(accuracy = 1))
```

---

# `size`

```{r}
pSupp
```

---

# .blue[Theory]

--

- These results indicate that polls which predict greater support for Biden **also** predict greater support for Trump

--

  - Is this consistent with the theory?
  
--

  - Recall that **Biden-biased** polls should underpredict Trump support and overpredict Biden support
  
--

  - In the .red[data], this would suggest a **negative** relationship
  
--

  - But we find a **positive** relationship
  
--

- **Inconsistent** with the theory, but raises another puzzle

--

- Why do polls that underpredict support for Biden also underpredict support for Trump?

--

  - .blue[Third party bias?] Polls bias against 3rd party candidates
  
--

  - .blue[Timing of poll?] Fewer uncertain responses closer to election
  
  - More next time!
