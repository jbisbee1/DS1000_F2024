# Agenda

1. Mutivariate

2. What is "conditional"?

3. Understanding Trump support

# Definition

--

- .red[Multi] + .blue[variate]

--

  - .red[Many] + .blue[variables]
  
--

  - Analysis of multiple variables
  
--

- When we analyze **multiple** variables, we are in the world of "conditional analysis"


---

# What is .blue[conditional]?

--

- Put simply: "conditional" means "depending on"

--

  - I.e., How does a variable of interest vary *depending on* some other variable?
  
--

  - "Variable of interest": the **outcome** (or **dependent** variable $Y$)
  
--

  - "Some other variable": the **predictor** (or **independent** variable $X$)
  
--

  - "Vary depending on": the **relationship**
  
--

- Mapping concepts into .red[data] .blue[science]

--

  - The .blue[relationship] between the .red[outcome] and the .red[predictor]
  
---

# What is .blue[conditional]?

--

- "Depending on" suggests a **causal** interpretation

--

  - High wages "depend on" education &rarr; education **causes** high wages

--

  - In .blue[theory], this is reasonable: students acquire skills in school which are valued by the labor market.
  
--

  - But the positive correlation between education and wages might also be **"spurious"**
  
--

  - Higher education *AND* higher wages are outcomes of some **true cause** (i.e., upbringing, SES, etc.)

--

**NOTE: The logic for why a relationship might be spurious is itself CAUSAL.**

---

# (Re-)Introducing the Data

--

- Using the Michigan exit poll data

--

- Download pre-wrangled data from [GitHub](https://github.com/jbisbee1/DS1000_S2023/blob/main/Lectures/4_Uni_Multivariate/data/MI2020_ExitPoll_small.rds) and save to your `data` folder.

--

- `require(tidyverse)` and `readRDS()` the data to `mi_ep` object

```{r,message=F,warning=F}
require(tidyverse)

mi_ep <- read_rds('https://github.com/jbisbee1/DS1000_F2024/raw/main/data/MI2020_ExitPoll_small.rds')
```

---

# Some Light .red[Data] .blue[Science]

--

- The "gender gap" in Trump support

--

- .blue[Theory]: Trump has expressed sexist views against women. Therefore, women should be less likely to support him.

--

  - **NOTE** the causal assumptions in this theory! 
  
--

- .red[Analysis]: compare support for Trump among men and women

--

- But first, some quick data wrangling

```{r}
MI_final_small <- mi_ep %>%
  filter(preschoice=="Donald Trump, the Republican" | preschoice=="Joe Biden, the Democrat") %>%
  mutate(BidenVoter=ifelse(preschoice=="Joe Biden, the Democrat",1,0),
         TrumpVoter=ifelse(BidenVoter==1,0,1),
         AGE10=ifelse(AGE10==99,NA,AGE10))
```

---

# Conditional Means

```{r}
MI_final_small %>%
  count(preschoice,SEX) %>%
  mutate(PctSupport = n/sum(n),
         PctSupport = round(PctSupport, digits=2))
```

--

- .red[Results] are **consistent** with the .blue[theory]

--

  - NB: .red[results] do not **prove** the .blue[theory]
  
---

# Conditional Means

- However, note that these proportions are out of *all* voters.

--

- This isn't directly addressing the .blue[theory]

--

  - We want to know the proportion **of women** who supported Trump
  
--

```{r}
MI_final_small %>%
  count(preschoice,SEX) %>%
  group_by(SEX) %>% #<<
  mutate(totGender = sum(n)) %>%
  mutate(pctSupport = n / totGender)
```
  
---

# Additional .blue[Theorizing]

--

- The strength of the theorized relationship might vary by age

--

  - Younger women might be more offended by Trump's casual sexism
  
--

  - Older women might be more inured to Trump's casual sexism
  
--

- .blue[Theory]: the "gender gap" will be larger among younger voters

--

  - (But also recognize that younger Americans are generally more progressive...meaning that **both** younger men and women are more offended by Trump's casual sexism!)
  
---

# Two-Way Conditional Means

--

- We could just subset with `filter()`

```{r}
MI_final_small %>%
  filter(AGE10==1) %>% #<<
  group_by(SEX) %>%
  count(preschoice) %>%
  mutate(PctSupport = n/sum(n),
         PctSupport = round(PctSupport, digits=2))
```

---

# Two-Way Conditional Means

- Or we could add `AGE10` to the `group_by`

```{r}
MI_final_small %>%
  group_by(SEX, AGE10) %>%
  summarize(PctTrump = mean(TrumpVoter),.groups = 'drop') %>%
  mutate(PctTrump = round(PctTrump, digits =2))
```

---

# Two-Way Conditional Means

- A little hard to make comparisons

```{r}
MI_final_small %>%
  group_by(SEX, AGE10) %>%
  summarize(PctTrump = mean(TrumpVoter),.groups = 'drop') %>%
  spread(SEX,PctTrump) %>% rename(Male = `1`,Female = `2`)
```


---

# Introducing `spread()` & `gather()`

- Data in `R` is either "long" or "wide"

--

- **Long**: One column for a categorical label and multiple rows
  
  - I.e., For each age group, we have one **row** for men and one **row** for women
  
--

- **Wide**: Multiple columns for each categorical label and a single row

  - I.e., For each age group, we have one **column** for men and one **column** for women
  
--

- In `R`, we can switch between **wide** and **long** with two functions:

--

  1. `spread()` (or `pivot_wider()`): converts from long to wide
  
  2. `gather()` (or `pivot_longer()`): converts from wide to long
  

---

# `spread()` and `gather()`

- `spread([key],[value])`

--

  - `key`: variable containing categories to make into columns labels
  
  - `value`: variable containing values put into these new columns

<center><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gadenbuie/tidy-animated-verbs/master/images/tidyr-spread-gather.gif" width=80%></center>

---

# `spread()` and `gather()`

- `gather([key],[value],[columns])`

  - `key`: name of **new column** that contains categories
  
  - `value`: values you want to put into this new column

<center><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gadenbuie/tidy-animated-verbs/master/images/tidyr-spread-gather.gif" width=80%></center>

---

# `pivot_wider()`

- `pivot_wider([names_from],[values_from])`

--

  - `names_from`: variable containing categories to make into column labels
  
  - `values_from`: variable containing values put into these new columns
  
--

<center><img src="https://www.fromthebottomoftheheap.net/assets/img/posts/tidyr-longer-wider.gif" width=80%></center>

---

# OR `pivot_longer()`

- `pivot_longer([names_from],[values_from])`

  - `names_from`: variable containing categories to make into column labels
  
  - `values_from`: variable containing values put into these new columns

<center><img src="https://www.fromthebottomoftheheap.net/assets/img/posts/tidyr-longer-wider.gif" width=80%></center>

---

# `spread()`

```{r}
MI_final_small %>%
  group_by(SEX, AGE10) %>%
  summarize(PctTrump = mean(TrumpVoter),.groups = 'drop') %>%
  spread(key = SEX,value = PctTrump,fill = NA) %>% #<<
  rename(Male = `1`,Female = `2`)
```

---

# `gather()`

```{r}
MI_final_small %>%
  group_by(SEX, AGE10) %>%
  summarize(PctTrump = mean(TrumpVoter),.groups = 'drop') %>%
  spread(key = SEX,value = PctTrump,fill = NA) %>%
  rename(Male = `1`,Female = `2`) %>%
  gather(SEX,PctTrump,-AGE10) #<<
```

---

# Save Summary for Later Use

```{r}
SexAge <- MI_final_small %>%
  group_by(SEX, AGE10) %>%
  summarize(PctTrump = mean(TrumpVoter),.groups = 'drop')

SexAge %>% filter(SEX == 2)
```


---

# Conditional Categorical Analysis

--

- Want to know **reason** for voting for candidate by **vote choice**

--

  - `Quality`: 4 category unordered
  
--

  - `preschoice`: 2 category unordered
  
--

- Some light data wrangling

```{r}
toplot <- mi_ep %>% 
    select(Quality,preschoice,SEX) %>%
    filter(grepl('Biden|Trump',preschoice)) %>%
    drop_na() %>%
    filter(Quality != "[DON'T READ] Donâ€™t know/refused") 
```

---

# Conditional Categorical Analysis

```{r,fig.align='center',fig.width=9,fig.height=5}
(pReasonOverall <- toplot %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Quality)) + 
  labs(y = "Number of Voters",x = "",
         title = "Reasons for voting for a candidate",
       subtitle = "Michigan 2020 Exit Poll") +
    geom_bar(color="black",alpha = .4))
```

---

# Conditional Categorical Analysis

--

- Can swap axes with `coord_flip()`

```{r,fig.align='center',fig.width=9,fig.height=5}
pReasonOverall + coord_flip()
```

---

# Conditional Categorical Analysis

--

- `fill` and `position = "dodge"` for **conditional** analysis
  
```{r}
pReasonChoice <- toplot %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Quality,fill = preschoice)) + 
  labs(y = "Number of Voters",x = "",
         title = "Reasons for voting for a candidate",
       subtitle = "Michigan 2020 Exit Poll",
       fill = 'Self-Reported Vote') +
    geom_bar(color="black",position = "dodge") + 
   coord_flip()
```

---

# Conditional Categorical Analysis

```{r,fig.align='center',fig.width=9,fig.height=5}
pReasonChoice
```

---

# Conditional Categorical Analysis

--

- What about if we do this by `SEX`?

--

```{r,fig.align='center',fig.width=9,fig.height=4.25}
toplot %>% 
    ggplot(aes(x= preschoice, fill = SEX)) +     
    labs(y = "Number of Respondents",x = "",
         title = "Vote by Respondent Sex",fill = "Sex") +
    geom_bar(position="dodge") + coord_flip()
```

---

# Be Attentive to `class()`

--

- How is `SEX` stored in the data?

```{r}
class(mi_ep$SEX)
```

--

- Need to convert it to a `character` or `factor`

```{r}
pVoteSex <- toplot %>% 
    ggplot(aes(x= preschoice, fill = factor(SEX))) +     
    labs(y = "Number of Respondents",x = "",
         title = "Vote by Respondent Sex",fill = "Sex") +
    geom_bar(position="dodge") + coord_flip()
```

---

# Be Attentive to `class()`

```{r,fig.align='center',fig.width=9,fig.height=4.5}
pVoteSex
```

--

- Why is this a bad visualization? **Poorly labeled legend!**

---
