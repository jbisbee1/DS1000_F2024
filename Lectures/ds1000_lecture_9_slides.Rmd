# Agenda

1. Overtime Polls + `weighted.mean()`

2. Predicting winner with Electoral College Votes

---

# 2020 polling

--

- Back into the data!

--

  - Download and open [`Pres2020_PV.Rds`](https://github.com/jbisbee1/DS1000_F2024/blob/main/data/Pres2020_PV.Rds)
  - Wrangle to get the popular vote margin, expressed in decimals
  
--

```{r,message=F,warning=F}
require(tidyverse)
poll <- read_rds('https://github.com/jbisbee1/DS1000_F2024/raw/main/data/Pres2020_PV.Rds')

poll <- poll %>%
  mutate(Trump = Trump/100,
         Biden = Biden/100,
         margin = Biden - Trump)
```


---

# .blue[Theory]

--

- Previous results indicate that polls which predict greater support for Biden **also** predict greater support for Trump

--

  - Is this consistent with the theory?
  
--

  - Recall that **Biden-biased** polls should underpredict Trump support and overpredict Biden support
  
--

  - In the .red[data], this would suggest a **negative** relationship
  
--

  - But we find a **positive** relationship
  
--

- **Inconsistent** with the theory, but raises another puzzle

--

- Why do polls that underpredict support for Biden also underpredict support for Trump?

--

  - .blue[Third party bias?] Polls bias against 3rd party candidates
  
--

  - .blue[Timing of poll?] Fewer uncertain responses closer to election


---

# Dates and More Dimensions

--

- To test the .blue[timing of polls theory], let's look at how predicted support varies over time

--

```{r}
poll %>%
  select(StartDate,EndDate,DaysinField)
```

---

# Dates

--

- Need to convert `StartDate` and `EndDate` into `date` class

--

```{r}
election.day <- as.Date("11/3/2020", "%m/%d/%Y")  
election.day

election.day16 <- as.Date("11/8/2016", "%m/%d/%Y")
election.day16

election.day - election.day16
```

---

# Wrangling

```{r}
toplot <- poll %>%
                mutate(EndDate = as.Date(EndDate, "%m/%d/%Y"), 
                      StartDate = as.Date(StartDate, "%m/%d/%Y"),
                      DaysToED = as.numeric(election.day - EndDate),
                      margin = Biden - Trump)
```

--

- How many polls were conducted over time?

---

# Polls by Date (`geom_bar`)

```{r}

  ggplot(aes(x = StartDate)) +

              color = "blue",se=T)
```

---

# Typing back to .blue[theory]

--

- Evidence of **both** Biden and Trump support increasing toward election

--

- Does this mean third party support waned?

--

- Does this mean that undecided voters made a decision?

# 3. The Electoral College

--

- U.S. presidents determined by the **Electoral College** (EC)

--

  - Each state allocated votes equal to their "congressional delegation"
  
--

  - One vote per Senator + one vote per **M**ember **o**f **t**he **H**ouse (MotH)

--

  - 100 Senators + 435 MotHs + 3 votes for DC = 538 total votes
  
--

  - To win the presidency, you need at least 270 EC votes
  
--

- What does this mean for representation?

--

  - Population divided equally\* across 435 MotHs
  
--

  - In 2020, each MotH represented 761,179 people

--

  - Geographic distribution of this population is **non-uniform**
  
---

# Assigning Districts

--

- Every 10 years, U.S. takes a census of its population

--

- Based on these results, congressional districts are reapportioned

--

- In 2010, Florida's pop. was ~19m & average pop. per MotH was ~710k

--

  - How many MotHs? `ceiling(19000000 / 710000)` = ``r ceiling(19000000 / 710000)``
  
--

  - Every state has 2 senators, so FL had 27 + 2 = 29 EC votes
  
--

  - In 2020, FL pop. was 21m &rarr; each resident had 0.00000137 of a vote

--

- What about Vermont?

--

  - 3 EC votes / 624,340 residents = 0.00000481
  
--

- Vermonters have roughly 3.5 times the influence of Floridians!

# Introducing Data

--

- We will attempt to use state polls to predict 2020 winner

--

- National polls are great at predicting popular vote share...

--

- ...but presidents aren't elected based on popular vote

--

- With a few exceptions, states have a "winner take all" system

--

  - Winner of state's popular vote gets **all** of the state's EC votes
  
--

- Thus we need good state-level polls

--

- Load [`Pres2020_StatePolls.Rds`](https://github.com/jbisbee1/DS1000_F2024/blob/main/data/Pres2020_StatePolls.Rds) to `statePoll` object

```{r,message = F,warning=F}
require(tidyverse)
statePoll <- read_rds('https://github.com/jbisbee1/DS1000_F2024/raw/main/data/Pres2020_StatePolls.Rds')
```

---

# Look at the data

```{r}
glimpse(statePoll)
```


---

# .blue[Scientific] Goal: Predict Winner

--

- Need to calculate predicted probability of Biden victory

--

  1. Fraction of polls with Biden in the lead
  
  2. Fraction of respondents supporting Biden
  
  3. Fraction of twoway respondents supporting Biden
  
--

- Wrangling time!

```{r}
statePoll <- statePoll %>%
  mutate(Biden2W = Biden / (Biden+Trump),
         Biden = Biden / 100,
         Trump = Trump/100)

stateProbs <- statePoll %>%
  group_by(StateName,State) %>%
  summarise(BidenProb1 = mean(Biden > Trump),
            BidenProb2 = mean(Biden),
            BidenProb3 = mean(Biden2W),
            EV = mean(EV),.groups = 'drop') # This is just the value of EV
```

---

# Looking at data

```{r}

---

# Visualizing Data

- `R` has fancy packages that allow for interactive plots (`plotly`)

```{r,message = F}

  ggplot(aes(x=BidenProb2, y=BidenProb3,text=paste(StateName))) + #<<

```

---

# Visualizing Data

```{r,message = F,warning=F}
ggplotly(gg,tooltip = 'text')
```


---

# Visualizing Data

--

- What about the % of polls that predict a Biden victory?

--

  - I.e., we know Trump won't win California or Biden won't win Tennessee

# Translate to EC Votes

--

- Start with a single state to get the idea

--

- **Expected Value** (EV...could also be Expected Votes): Probability * Value

```{r}
stateProbs %>%
  filter(State == 'PA') %>%
  mutate(BEV1 = BidenProb1 * EV,
         BEV2 = BidenProb2 * EV,
         BEV3 = BidenProb3 * EV) %>%
  select(EV,matches('^B.*\\d'))
```

--

- Probability matters! Biden could get between 18.3 and 9.98 votes in PA!

---

# Translate to EC Votes

- Do this for every state

```{r}
stateProbs %>%
  mutate(BidenEV1 = BidenProb1 * EV,
         BidenEV2 = BidenProb2 * EV,
         BidenEV3 = BidenProb3 * EV,
         TrumpEV1 = EV - BidenEV1,
         TrumpEV2 = EV - BidenEV2,
         TrumpEV3 = EV - BidenEV3) %>%
  summarise_at(vars(matches('EV\\d')),sum) # Fancy shortcut!
```

--

- Overall EC votes *always* favored Biden (always above 270)

--

- But none of our estimates are close to the true outcome of 306 to 232

---

# .blue[Science] Questions

--

- We know that **national** polls changed closer to election

--

- Can we do better if we look only at **state** polls close to election day?

--

- .red[Data] limitations!

```{r}
pollsPerState <- statePoll %>%
  filter(DaysToED <= 3) %>%
  count(State) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = n,y = reorder(State,n))) + 
  geom_bar(stat = 'identity',alpha = .7) + 
  labs(title = 'Number of Polls per State',
       subtitle = 'Last 3 Days before Election Day',
       x = 'Number of Polls',
       y = '')
```

---

# .red[Data] Limitations

```{r,fig.height=7,echo = F}
pollsPerState
```


---

# Do better with recent polls?

```{r}
statePoll %>%
  filter(DaysToED <= 3) %>% #<<
  group_by(StateName,State) %>%
  summarise(BidenProb1 = mean(Biden > Trump),
            BidenProb2 = mean(Biden),
            BidenProb3 = mean(Biden2W),
            EV = mean(EV),.groups = 'drop') %>%
  mutate(BidenEV1 = BidenProb1 * EV,
         BidenEV2 = BidenProb2 * EV,
         BidenEV3 = BidenProb3 * EV,
         TrumpEV1 = EV - BidenEV1,
         TrumpEV2 = EV - BidenEV2,
         TrumpEV3 = EV - BidenEV3) %>%
  summarise_at(vars(matches('EV\\d')),sum)
```


---

# Conclusion

--

- Still not nailing the true votes!

--

  - Not even within the distributions of the bootstrapped estimates!
  
--

- Why?

--

  1. Polls have their own uncertainty (could weight by total respondents?)
  
  2. Polls might not be representative of voters
  
  3. Polls might not be independent of each other
