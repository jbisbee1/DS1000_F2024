# Agenda

1. Uncertainty

2. More NBA data

3. Bootstrap Sampling

---

# The Missing Ingrediant

--

- Thus far we have:

--

  1. Tested whether **selective** schools have **higher SAT scores**: .blue[Yes]
  
  2. Tested Trump's theory that **polls were biased against him**: .blue[No]
  
  3. Tested whether RDD polls **contact more Trump supporters**: .blue[No]
  
  4. Tested whether state polls **accurately predicted the president**: .blue[No]
  
--

- We want to do more than say "Yes" or "No" when answering a .blue[Research Question] or making a .red[Prediction]

--

- We want to express our **confidence**

---

# What is "confidence"?

- In frequentist statistics:

--

  - How often your conclusion would be correct if you were able to run an "experiment" many times

--

  - How often your conclusion would be correct if you were able to observe the world many times
  
--

- .blue[Research Question]: Are NBA players in their rookie season more prone to turnovers?

--

  - .blue[Theory]: ??
  
  - .blue[Hypothesis]: ??
  
--

- .red[Analysis]: compare `tov` by `isRookie`
  
---

# NBA Example

```{r,message=F,warning=F}
require(tidyverse)
nba <- read_rds('https://github.com/jbisbee1/DS1000_F2024/raw/main/data/nba_players_2018.Rds')
glimpse(nba %>% select(tov,isRookie))
```

---

# Look

```{r}
summary(nba %>% select(tov,isRookie))
```

---

# Visualize: Univariate $Y$

```{r}
nba %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = tov)) + 
  geom_density()
```

---

# Visualize: Univariate $X$

```{r}
nba %>%
  count(isRookie) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = n,y = isRookie)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = 'identity')
```

---

# Visualize: Multivariate

- Option #1: `summarise()` data prior to plotting

```{r,fig.height=4}
nba %>%
  group_by(isRookie) %>% 
  summarise(meanTOV = mean(tov,na.rm=T)) %>% #<<
  ggplot(aes(x = isRookie,y = meanTOV)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = 'identity')
```

---

# Visualize: Multivariate

- Option #2: plot raw data

```{r,fig.height=4}
nba %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = isRookie,y = tov)) + 
  geom_boxplot()
```
---

# Uncertainty

--

- Are rookies **better** than more senior players?

--

- Big philosophical step back

--

  - We live in a stochastic universe!

# Uncertainty

- Are rookies **better** than more senior players?

--

- Populations versus samples
  
--

  - Intro stats: uncertainty due to **sample**
  
---

# Uncertainty

- Big philosophical step back

  - We live in a stochastic universe!
  
- What does **better** mean?

--

  - .blue[Theory]: An innate quality in greater abundance
  
--

  - .blue[Prediction]: If we had to bet on who turns over the ball less, who do we choose?
  
--

- How **confident** would we be with this bet?

---

# Uncertainty

- If the universe is inherently stochastic, we are inherently uncertain

--

  - We THINK rookies are more careful passers, but not 100% certain
  
--

- How to measure this?

--

  - Run 100 experimental seasons
  
--

  - Record turnovers for rookies and non-rookies for each season
  
--

  - Calculate how many times rookies turned the ball over less than non-rookies
  
--

- 90 seasons out of 100 &rarr; 90% confident / certainty

--

- 100 seasons out of 100 &rarr; 100%?

--

- **FUNDAMENTAL STOCHASTIC NATURE OF REALITY (FSNoR)**

---

# Uncertainty

--

- Running 100 experimental seasons is impossible

--

  1. We are not Adam Silver
  2. Even if we were Adam Silver, 100 seasons = a century of basketball!

# Uncertainty

- Running 100 experimental seasons is impossible

  1. We are not Adam Silver
  2. Even if we were Adam Silver, 100 seasons = a century of basketball!
  3. If we were God? 100 seasons with the same players?
  
--

- *STILL wouldn't be 100% certain due to **FSNoR***

--

  - (**F**undamental **S**tochastic **N**ature **o**f **R**eality)

---

# Uncertainty

--

- But we are data scientists

--

- Take 1 season of basketball but sample it randomly

--

- **Bootstrap sampling**

--

- .blue[Theory]: By mimicking the sampling process, we can simulate a God experiment

--

  - (NB: this goes much deeper. Uncertainty from bootstrap combines FSNoR + sampling uncertainty.)
  
--

- .red[Practice]: `sample_n()` + `for()` loops

---

# Bootstrap Demo Step 1

- One randomly sampled player via `sample_n(size,replace)`

--

  - `size`: how many samples (from 1 to all observations)
  
  - `replace`: whether to put the sample back (`TRUE` or `FALSE`)

```{r}
set.seed(123) # Ensure we can reproduce results exactly

nba %>%
  sample_n(size = 1,replace = T) %>% 
  select(namePlayer,slugSeason,isRookie,tov)
```

---

# Bootstrap Demo Step 2

- Two randomly sampled players

```{r}
set.seed(123)
nba %>%
  sample_n(size = 1,replace = T) %>% select(namePlayer,slugSeason,isRookie,tov)

nba %>%
  sample_n(size = 1,replace = T) %>% select(namePlayer,slugSeason,isRookie,tov)
```

---

# Bootstrap Demo Step 2

- OR two randomly sampled players

```{r}
set.seed(123)

nba %>%
  sample_n(size = 2,replace = T) %>% select(namePlayer,slugSeason,isRookie,tov)
```


---

# Bootstrap Demo Step 3

- Randomly sample all players: `size = nrow(nba)` (or `nrow(.)`)


```{r}
set.seed(123)

nba %>%
  sample_n(size = nrow(nba),replace = T) %>% # Same as nrow(.)
  select(namePlayer,slugSeason,isRookie,tov)
```

---

# Bootstrap Demo Step 4

- Linking to **confidence**: Do we draw the same conclusion twice?

```{r}
set.seed(123)

# Bootstrapped Season #1
bsSeason1 <- nba %>%
  sample_n(size = nrow(.),replace = T) %>%
  select(isRookie,tov) %>%
  mutate(bsSeason = 1)

# Bootstrapped Season #2
bsSeason2 <- nba %>%
  sample_n(size = nrow(.),replace = T) %>%
  select(isRookie,tov) %>%
  mutate(bsSeason = 2)
```

---

# Bootstrap Demo Step 4

- Linking to **confidence**: Do we draw the same conclusion twice?

```{r}
bsSeason1 %>%
  group_by(isRookie) %>%
  summarise(mean_tov = mean(tov))

bsSeason2 %>%
  group_by(isRookie) %>%
  summarise(mean_tov = mean(tov))
```

---

# Bootstrap Demo Step 5

- Want to do this 100 times!

--

- Use a `for()` loop to make it cleaner

--

- A `for()` loop repeats the same code multiple times

--

  - Benefit: don't need to copy and paste a chunk of code 100 times
  
  - Just put a chunk of code in a loop that repeats 100 times!

```{r}
set.seed(123) # Ensure you'll get the same results each time
bsSeasons <- NULL # Instantiate empty object
for(bsSeason in 1:100) { # Repeat 100 times
  tmpSeason <- nba %>%
    sample_n(size = nrow(.),replace = T) %>% # Sample the data
    select(isRookie,tov) %>% # Select variables of interest
    mutate(bsSeasonNumber = bsSeason) # Save the simulation ID
  bsSeasons <- bind_rows(bsSeasons,tmpSeason) # Append to the empty object!
}
```


---

# Bootstrap to measure Confidence

--

- Compare rookie versus non-rookie turnovers each season

```{r}
bsSeasons %>%
  group_by(bsSeasonNumber,isRookie) %>%
  summarise(mean_tov = mean(tov),.groups = 'drop')
```

---

# Bootstrap to measure Confidence

- Compare rookie versus non-rookie turnovers each season

```{r,fig.width=9,fig.height=5}
bsSeasons %>%
  group_by(bsSeasonNumber,isRookie) %>%
  summarise(mean_tov = mean(tov),.groups = 'drop') %>%
  spread(isRookie,mean_tov) #<<
```


---

# Bootstrap to measure Confidence

- Compare rookie versus non-rookie turnovers each season

```{r,fig.width=9,fig.height=5}
bsSeasons %>%
  group_by(bsSeasonNumber,isRookie) %>%
  summarise(mean_tov = mean(tov),.groups = 'drop') %>%
  spread(isRookie,mean_tov) %>% #<<
  filter(complete.cases(.)) %>%
  mutate(rookieBetter = ifelse(`FALSE` > `TRUE`,1,0))
```

---

# Bootstrap to measure Confidence

- Compare UVA and UT's FT percentages in each season

```{r,fig.width=9,fig.height=5}
(conf <- bsSeasons %>%
  group_by(bsSeasonNumber,isRookie) %>%
  summarise(mean_tov = mean(tov),.groups = 'drop') %>%
  spread(isRookie,mean_tov) %>% #<<
  filter(complete.cases(.)) %>%
  mutate(rookieBetter = ifelse(`FALSE` > `TRUE`,1,0)) %>%
  summarise(rookieBetter = mean(rookieBetter)))
```

--

- Rookies have fewer turnovers `r round(conf$rookieBetter*100,1)`% of the time! (How much do you bet on next season?)

---

# Other ways to use bootstraps

- Could plot the **distributions** for each school

```{r,warning=F,message=F}
 bsSeasons %>%
  group_by(bsSeasonNumber,isRookie) %>%
  summarise(mean_tov = mean(tov),.groups = 'drop') %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = mean_tov,fill = isRookie)) + 
  geom_density(alpha = .3)
```

---

# Other ways to use bootstraps

- Could plot the **distributions** of the "estimate"

```{r,warning=F,message=F}
p <- bsSeasons %>%
  group_by(bsSeasonNumber,isRookie) %>%
  summarise(mean_tov = mean(tov),.groups = 'drop') %>%
  spread(isRookie,mean_tov) %>% #<<
  mutate(estimate = `FALSE` - `TRUE`) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = estimate)) + 
  geom_density(alpha = .3) + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0,linetype = 'dashed')
```

---

# Other ways to use bootstraps

- Could plot the **distributions** of the "estimate"

```{r,message = F,warning=F}
p
```

---

# Where to calculate the "estimate"

- **First** we created a new dataset of 100 simulated seasons

--

- **Then** we calculate average FT % for TN and UVA for each simulation

--

- **Finally** we calculate proportion of times average is higher for TN

--

- **BUT!** It is equally valid to calculate the "estimate" *within* the `for()` loop

```{r}
set.seed(123)
bsRes <- NULL
for(counter in 1:100) {
  tmpEst <- nba %>%
    sample_n(size = nrow(.),replace = T) %>%
    group_by(isRookie) %>%
    summarise(mean_tov = mean(tov,na.rm=T)) %>% #<<
    mutate(bsSeason = counter)
  
  bsRes <- bind_rows(bsRes,tmpEst)
}
```

---

# Where to calculate the "estimate"

```{r}
bsRes %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = mean_tov,fill = isRookie)) + 
  geom_density(alpha = .3)
```

---

# Where to calculate the "estimate"

```{r,warning=F,message=F}
bsRes %>%
  spread(isRookie,mean_tov) %>%
  mutate(rookieBetter = `FALSE` - `TRUE`) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = rookieBetter)) + 
  geom_density(alpha = .3) + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0,linetype = 'dashed')
```

---

# Where to calculate the "estimate"

- Same confidence measure

```{r}
bsRes %>%
  spread(key = isRookie,value = mean_tov) %>%
  mutate(rookieBetter = ifelse(`FALSE` > `TRUE`,1,0)) %>%
  summarise(confidence = mean(rookieBetter,na.rm=T))
```

---

# Interpreting Confidence

- **Is this high?**

--

  - What value reflects the minimum confidence?
  
--

  - A coin flip &rarr; 50%
  
--

- What does a confidence level of 0.1 (or 10%) mean?

--

  - We are 100% confident?

---

# Do we believe this?

- Why might this conclusion be **spurious**?

--

- Rookies get less playing time

- Therefore fewer opportunities to turn the ball over

--

- Solution? Turnovers per minute (or hour)

---

# Re-evaluating

```{r}
nba <- nba %>%
  mutate(tov_hr = tov*60 / minutes) 

nba %>%
  group_by(isRookie) %>%
  summarise(tov_hr = mean(tov_hr))
```

---

# Re-evaluating

```{r}
set.seed(123)
bsRes <- NULL
for(counter in 1:100) {
  tmpEst <- nba %>%
    sample_n(size = nrow(.),replace = T) %>%
    group_by(isRookie) %>%
    summarise(mean_tov = mean(tov_hr,na.rm=T)) %>% #<<
    mutate(bsSeason = counter)
  
  bsRes <- bind_rows(bsRes,tmpEst)
}
```

---

# Re-evaluating

```{r}
bsRes %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = mean_tov,fill = isRookie)) + 
  geom_density(alpha = .3)
```

---

# Re-Evaluating

```{r}
bsRes %>%
  mutate(isRookie = ifelse(isRookie == TRUE,'Rookie','Not Rookie')) %>%
  spread(isRookie,mean_tov) %>%
  summarise(conf = mean(`Not Rookie` > Rookie))
```



---

# Other Applications

- Could do the same to express **confidence** in conclusions about:

--

  - The relationship between SAT scores and selective admissions
  
  - The relationship between MSM polls and anti-Trump bias
  
  - Whether state polls are good at predicting the 2020 president

---

# Conclusion

--

- Anyone can spit stats

<center><img src="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/sports.png" width=30%></center>

--

- Data scientists are comfortable with **.blue[uncertainty]**
