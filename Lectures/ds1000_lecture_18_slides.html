# Agenda

1. Structure in data

2. "Clustering"

3. Application

---

# Structure

--

- Patterns in data

--

- Behind everything we've done thus far

--

  - .blue[Theory Testing:] structure answers research question
  
  - .blue[Prediction:] structure improves accuracy
  
--

- A third "camp" in data science: **Learning**

---

# Learning

--

- No research question, no prediction goal

--

  - Just want to learn about **structure** of data
  
--

- Existing tools can do it

--

  - Run 1m regressions
  
  - Visualize a thousand variables
  
--

  - But these are *slow*
  
--

- This topic: letting **algorithms** learn for you!

--

  - Today: .red[clustering]

---

# Clustering

--

- Identify observations that belong to groups

--

  - Similarities &amp;rarr; group belonging
  
--

- Part of broader set of methods to identify underlying "structure"

--

  - Today: *k*-means clustering algorithm
  
---

# *k*-means Clustering

--

- *k*: number of clusters (i.e., groups)

--

- Algorithm assigns each observation to these `\(1\dots k\)` groups

--

  1. Choose initial "centroids" at random

--
  
  2. Assign observations to each centroid based on "Euclidean distance"

--
  
  3. Calculate new centroid based on mean of each variable

--
  
  4. Repeat until assignments stabilize

- `\(c^2 = a^2 + b^2\)` &amp;rarr; `\(c = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\)`

--

- `\(a^2 = (x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2\)` &amp; `\(b^2 = (x_3 - x_2)^2 + (y_3 - y_2)^2\)`

--

- General: `\(\sqrt{\sum_i (q_i - p_i)^2}\)`

# DW-NOMINATE

- DW-NOMINATE is a measure of how frequently different legislators vote together

--

- Often interpreted as "ideology"

--

- Two-dimensions:

--

  1. Standard left-right ideology (size of gov, redistribution, etc.)
  
  2. Second dimension changes, but typically **salient social issues**
  
--

- Can `\(k\)`-means clustering help us learn about legislators?

# Intuition Check

--

- Can we see some clusters?

  - What do we think these are?
  
--

- Let's try estimating `\(k\)`-means!

--

- Function `kmeans(x,centers,iter.max,nstart)`

--

  - `x` is the data (only select the columns of interest!)
  
  - `centers` is the number of centroids
  
  - `iter.max` maximum amount of "steps"
  
  - `nstart` how many times to re-estimate
  
---

# Clustering on Ideology

- First, some light wrangling (convert numeric party code to character)


```r
datClust &lt;- dat %&gt;% 
  mutate(party = ifelse(party_code == 200,'R',
                        ifelse(party_code == 100,'D','I'))) %&gt;%
  mutate(nameParty = paste0(bioname,' (',party,')')) %&gt;%
  select(nominate_dim1,nominate_dim2,nameParty) %&gt;% drop_na()
```

---

# Clustering on Ideology

- Second, estimate `kmeans()` function


```r
m &lt;- kmeans(x = datClust %&gt;% select(nominate_dim1,nominate_dim2),
            centers = 2)

m
```

```

# Clustering on Ideology

- Easier to see output with the help of `tidymodels` package


```r
require(tidymodels)
tidy(m)
```

```
## # A tibble: 2 × 5
##   nominate_dim1 nominate_dim2  size withinss cluster
##           &lt;dbl&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;fct&gt;  
## 1         0.261        -0.244   214     33.4 1

```

--

- First two columns are the **locations** of the centroids

- `size` is the number of observations associated with each group

- `withinss` is the **errors** each centroid makes

---

# Clustering on Ideology

- Third, plot points and color by cluster


```r
ggClust &lt;- datClust %&gt;%
  mutate(cluster = m$cluster) %&gt;% # Add cluster to data
  ggplot(aes(x = nominate_dim1, y = nominate_dim2, 
             color = factor(cluster),
             text=nameParty)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = 'DW-Nominate Dimension 1',
       y = 'DW-Nominate Dimension 2',
       title="97th Congress Ideology",
       color = "Cluster")

- Simple rule: look for the "elbow"

             k = k) %&gt;%
    bind_rows(totWSS)
}
```

# Looking for the "elbow"


```r
totWSS %&gt;%
  ggplot(aes(x = k,y = totWSS)) + 
  geom_line() + geom_point() +

# Clustering Randomness

- Can overcome with `nstart`

--

  - Attempts multiple initial centroids and chooses the "best"
  

```r
set.seed(42)
c1 &lt;- kmeans(datClust %&gt;% select(-nameParty),centers = 2,nstart = 25)

set.seed(123)
c2 &lt;- kmeans(datClust %&gt;% select(-nameParty),centers = 2,nstart = 25)

table(c1$cluster,c2$cluster)
```

```
##    
##       1   2
##   1 166   0
##   2   0 279

# Is Polarization Increasing?

- Compare 97th Congress (1981-1983) to 117th Congress (2021-2023)


```r

                        ifelse(party_code == 100,'D','I'))) %&gt;%
  mutate(nameParty = paste0(bioname,' (',party,')')) %&gt;% # combine name + party
  select(nominate_dim1,nominate_dim2,nameParty) %&gt;% drop_na()
```

- Check for the "elbow"


```r

for(k in 1:10) {
  m.cluster &lt;- datClust %&gt;%
    select(-nameParty) %&gt;% kmeans(centers = k,nstart = 25)

}
```

# Check for the "elbow"


```r

  labs(x = 'Number of Clusters',y = 'Total WSS') +
