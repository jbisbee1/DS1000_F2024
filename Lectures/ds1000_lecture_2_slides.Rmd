---

# How `R` Works

--

- **O**bject **O**riented **L**anguage (**OOL**)

--

  - Objects are created with the `<-` command
  
--

  - You *can* run code directly...
  

```{r}
2+2
```

---

# How `R` Works


- **O**bject **O**riented **L**anguage (**OOL**)

  - Objects are created with the `<-` command

  - ...but most of what we'll do involves objects
  

```{r}
object1 <- 2+2
```

--

- Object assignment operator **saves** the output

- It **does not print** the output

--

- To see, just call the object

```{r}
object1
```

---

# How `R` Works


- **O**bject **O**riented **L**anguage (**OOL**)

  - Objects are created with the `<-` command

  - They can be named anything (so be intuitive!)
  

```{r}
three_plus_three <- 2+2
three_plus_three
```

---

# How `R` Works

- **O**bject **O**riented **L**anguage (**OOL**)

  - Objects are created with the `<-` command

  - Objects can store many different things
  
```{r}
an_element <- 2+2
a_vector <- c(1,2,3)
a_list <- list('element1' = 2+2,
               'element2' = "hello world!",
               'element3' = runif(n = 10,min = 0,max = 10))
a_function <- function(x) {
  avg_of_x <- sum(x) / length(x)
  return(avg_of_x)
}
```

---

# How `R` Works

- Objects **persist!**
```{r}
an_element # This object stores 2+2
a_vector   # This object stores the integers 1, 2, and 3

an_element*a_vector
an_element-a_vector
```

---

# A comment on comments

- If you use a # sign inside a code chunk, you can write a comment

```{r}
# This is a comment. If I compile the code, nothing will happen.

# This is another comment. These are helpful for annotating my code.
```

---

# How `R` Works

- Objects **persist!**
```{r}
# This object stores:
  # 1) 2+2 (named "element1")
  # 2) the text "hello world!" (named "element2")
  # 3) 10 numbers randomly drawn between 0 and 10
a_list
```

---

# How `R` Works

- Objects **persist!**
```{r}
# Let's apply our function ("a_function") to "element3" in "a_list"
a_function(x = a_list[['element3']])
```

--

- We could also call `element3` from `a_list` with a dollar sign

```{r}
# This does the same thing as the previous slide...it just accesses element3 differently.
a_function(x = a_list$element3)
```

---

# How `RStudio` Works

--

- `RStudio` is a powerful way to interact with `R`

--

- In base `R`, you interact with the program via the "command line"

--

  - For example...
  
--

- But to save your work, you can write "scripts"

--

  - For example...
  
--

- *This is all cumbersome!*

--

- Enter, `RStudio`

---

# How `RStudio` Works

--

- `RStudio` allows us to:

--

  1. Write scripts
  2. Run scripts
  3. See results

--

- It is **deeply interactive**

--

  - We can highlight a line and press `ctrl+enter` / `cmd+enter` and see the result
  
--

  - **We can even do this with single objects!**
  
---

# Give it a try

- Comment **everything**

--

- Create two objects

  - `a` contains the product of 3 and 5 (`3*5`)
  
  - `b` contains five numbers `c(10,21,43,87,175)`
  
--

- Now create object `c` which is `a - b`

```{r}
# INSERT CODE HERE
```

---

# Functions & Packages

--

- What are `packages`?

--

  - Basically, **functions** that someone else wrote
  
--

- `R` has many functions already installed

--

  - These are known as "base `R`" and contain many useful functions

--

  - For example, `sum()` will add up a vector of numbers

--

```{r,echo=TRUE,eval=FALSE}
sum(object1)
```
  
--

  - Quiz: What does the `mean()` function do? The `median()`? The `range()`?
  
--

- Other base `R` functions interact with other files

--

  - For example, `read.csv()` will load a `.csv` file
  
--

- And there are MANY **MANY** more

---

# Installing Packages

--

- In addition to the functions included in base `R`, we want more

--

- For this class, we want one called `tidyverse`

--

  - `tidyverse` contains many (hundreds?) of functions that make `R` easier
  
--

  - But it is NOT included in the base `R` set of functions
  
--

  - Therefore, we need to add it
  
--

- Use the base `R` function `install.packages("[PACKAGE NAME]")`

--

  - Specifically, `install.packages("tidyverse")`
  
---

# Requiring Packages

--

- Once installed, a package will live somewhere on your computer

--

- However, any new *instance* of `R` will not automatically load the packages

--

- We need to `require()` them to tell `R` to load them

--

  - Alternatively, we can use `library()` (but it's the same result)
  
--

- So load the `tidyverse` package with `require(tidyverse)`

```{r,echo=FALSE,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
require(tidyverse)
```

--

  - NB: you need quotes for the `install.packages()` function...
  
--

    - i.e., `install.packages("tidyverse")`
    
--

  - but NOT for the `require()` function
  
--

    - i.e., `require(tidyverse)`
  
---

# Loading Data

--

- So you should be using `R` via `RStudio` with the `tidyverse` package loaded

--

- Now let's load some data

--

- You can save it locally from the course  [github page](https://github.com/jbisbee1/DS1000_S2024/blob/main/data/sc_debt.Rds) and then load it from your computer
  
--

- Or you can load it directly from the internet with the `read_rds()` function from `tidyverse`

--

  - NB: `R` is an "object-oriented language" (OOL)

--

  - We **create** an "object" to store the data using a left-arrow: `<-`

--

```{r}
df <- read_rds('https://github.com/jbisbee1/DS1000_S2024/raw/main/data/sc_debt.Rds')
```


---

# Loading Data

--

- We now have the contents of `sc_debt.Rds` stored in the object `df`

--

  - This is a "tabular data frame", aka a `tibble`
  
  - **Rows** are observations
  
  - **Columns** are values

--

- We can look at this object directly

```{r}
df
```

---

# Loading Data

--

- Or we can look at its columns

```{r}
names(df)
```

---

# Loading Data

--

```{r,echo=FALSE,message=FALSE}
defs <- data.frame(Name = names(df),
                   Definition = c('Unit ID','Institution Name','State Abbreviation','Median Debt of Graduates',
                            'Control Public or Private','Census Region','Predominant Degree Offered: Assocates or Bachelors',
                            'Open Admissions Policy: 1=Yes, 2=No, 3=No 1st time students',
                            'Admissions Rate: proportion of applications accepted','Type of institution*',
                            'Average SAT scores',
                            'Average Earnings of Recent Graduates',
                            'Number of undergraduates',
                            'Average cost of attendance (tuition-grants)',
                            'Institution admits fewer than 10% of applications, 1=Yes, 0=No',
                            'Institution is a research university, 1=Yes, 0=No'))
```

```{r,echo=FALSE,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
require(kableExtra)
defs %>%
  kbl() %>%
  kable_paper("hover", full_width = F,font_size = 13)
```

# Manipulating the Data

--

- These data are cool!

--

- But TMI at first

--

- I want to know...

--

  - Where is `Vanderbilt University`?
  
--

  - Who is the most selective?
  
--

  - Which schools produce the richest grads?
  
--

- There are `tidyverse` functions to answer all of these questions

---

# Manipulating with `tidyverse`

- The code process of `tidyverse` relies on a "pipe" symbol: `%>%`

--

  - I don't like this name
  
  - I think it should be called a "chain" because it **links code together**
  
  - Or maybe a "do" symbol because it tells `R` what to do
  
--

- The basic grammar of `R` is: object, `%>%`, verb

```{r,eval=FALSE}
object %>%  # This is the object
   function() # This is the verb
```

---

# Manipulating with `tidyverse`

- `tidyverse` has many useful "verbs" (i.e., functions)

  - `filter()`: subsets **rows**
  
  - `select()`: subsets **columns**
  
  - `arrange()`: sorts **rows** based on **columns**
  
  - `summarise()`: collapses **rows**
  
  - `group_by()`: groups **rows** by **columns**
  
---

# Manipulating: `filter()`

- So let's look at Vandy

--

- `filter` will select **rows** of the data based on some criteria

--

```{r}
df %>%
  filter(instnm == "Vanderbilt University") # Only select rows with Vandy
```

---

# Manipulating: `select()`

- Still TMI!

--

- I only care about the admissions rate (`adm_rate`), the SAT scores (`sat_avg`), and the future earnings (`md_earn_wne_p6`)

--

- `select` will select **columns**

```{r}
df %>%
  filter(instnm == "Vanderbilt University") %>%
  select(instnm,adm_rate,sat_avg,md_earn_wne_p6) # Only select four columns
```

---

# Manipulating: `arrange()`

- How does Vandy compare...?

--

  - to other schools in terms of SAT scores?
  
  - to other schools in terms of future earnings?
  
  - to other schools in terms of admissions rates?

--

- `arrange` will sort the data based on a column (ascending!)

```{r}
df %>%
  arrange(sat_avg) %>% # Sort data by SAT scores
  select(instnm,sat_avg) # Only look at name and SAT scores
```

---

# Manipulating: `arrange()`

- Vandy is not in the bottom 10 schools

```{r}
df %>%
  arrange(sat_avg) %>% # Sort data by SAT scores
  select(instnm,sat_avg) # Only look at name and SAT scores
```

---

# Manipulating: `arrange()`

- Use `desc()` to order in descending values...Vandy not in top 10 either

```{r}
df %>%
  arrange(desc(sat_avg)) %>% # Sort data by SAT scores (descending)
  select(instnm,sat_avg) # Only look at name and SAT scores
```

---

# Manipulating: `arrange()`

- What if we look only at "selective" schools (i.e., those who accept less than 10% of applicants)?

--

```{r}
df %>%
  filter(adm_rate < .1) %>% # Only look at schools who accept less than 10%
  arrange(sat_avg,adm_rate) %>% # Sort data by SAT scores AND THEN admissions rates (breaks ties)
  select(instnm,adm_rate,sat_avg) # Only look at name, admissions rate, and SAT scores
```


---

# How does Vandy compare?

--

- `arrange` in descending order

```{r}
df %>%
  filter(adm_rate < .1) %>%
  arrange(desc(sat_avg),adm_rate) %>%
  select(instnm,adm_rate,sat_avg)
```



---

# More complicated? More `%>%`!

--

- Less selective schools by SAT with debt and state

```{r}
df %>%
  filter(adm_rate > .2 & adm_rate < .3) %>% # Less selective schools (accept between 20% and 30%)
  arrange(stabbr,desc(sat_avg)) %>% # Sort by state name, then by SAT scores
  select(instnm,sat_avg,grad_debt_mdn,stabbr) # Only look at some columns
```

---

# A quick aside on missingness

--

- Some rows have `NA` in some columns

--

  - `NA` is the standard code for **missing data** in `R`
  
  - Data can be missing for many different reasons (i.e., some schools don't require SAT scores or record them)
  
  - We can use a base `R` function called `is.na()` which will be `TRUE` if the value is `NA` or `FALSE` otherwise
  
--

  - And we can combine `is.na()` with the `filter()` function from `tidyverse`

--

- We will return to this in the lectures on **data wrangling**
  
--

- For now, how many schools don't report SAT scores?

```{r}
df %>%
  filter(is.na(sat_avg)) %>% # Only look at schools that DON'T report SATs
  select(instnm,stabbr) # Only look at the name and the state
```


---

# Stepping back

--

- Thus far, lots of .red[data]

--

- Not a lot of .blue[science]

--

- But remember the .blue[Research] camp!

--

  1. .red[Observation] &rarr; .blue[Question]

  2. .blue[Theory] &rarr; .blue[Hypothesis]

  3. .red[Data Collection / Wrangling] &rarr; .red[Analysis]

  4. .red[Results] &rarr; .blue[Conclusion]
  
--

- We have been doing lots of .red[Observation]!

--

- Do we have any good .blue[Research questions]?

---

# Stepping back

- .blue[RQ]: How might admissions and SAT scores be **related**?

--

  - .blue[Theory]: selective schools have stricter criteria
  
--

  - .blue[Hypothesis]: admissions and SAT scores should be **negatively** related
  
--

- How can we test this hypothesis?


---

# Summarizing Data: `summarise()` + `mean()`

--

- We can combine base `R` functions with `tidyverse` functions!

--

  - Base `R`: `mean()`
  
  - `tidyverse`: `summarise()` (aka `summarize()`)
  
- Overall average SAT scores

```{r}
df %>%
  summarise(mean_sat = mean(sat_avg,na.rm=T)) # Average SAT scores for entire data
```

---

# Summarizing Data

--

- Let's unpack this

```{r,eval=F}
df %>%
  summarise(mean_sat = mean(sat_avg,na.rm=T))
```

--

  - Create new variable `mean_sat` that contains the `mean()` of every school's average SAT score
  
--

  - `na.rm=T` means we want to ignore missing data. If not?
  
--
  
```{r,eval=T}
df %>%
  summarise(mean_sat = mean(sat_avg))
```

---

# Summarizing Data

--

- Recall we want see if more selective schools have higher SAT scores

--

```{r,eval=T}
df %>%
  filter(adm_rate < .1) %>% # Only look at schools who accept less than 10% of applicants
  summarise(mean_sat_LT10 = mean(sat_avg,na.rm=T)) # Calculate the average SAT score
```

```{r,eval=T}
df %>%
  filter(adm_rate > .1) %>% # Only look at schools who accept more than 10% of applicants
  summarise(mean_sat_GT20 = mean(sat_avg,na.rm=T)) # Calculate the average SAT score
```

---

# Summarizing Data: `group_by()`

--

- One final `tidyverse` function: `group_by()`

--

- There is a column called `selective` which is either 1 or 0

--

  - 1: the admissions rate is less than 10%
  
  - 0: otherwise
  
--

```{r}
df %>%
  select(instnm,selective,adm_rate)
```

---

# Summarizing Data: `group_by()`

- Instead of running two separate `filter()` commands, use `group_by()`

--

```{r,eval=T}
df %>%
  group_by(selective) %>% # Group the data by selective (either 1 or 0)
  summarise(mean_sat = mean(sat_avg,na.rm=T)) # Calculate average SAT for each group
```

---

# Results

- Do more selective schools have higher SAT scores?

--

- Yes

--

- This .red[Result] **confirms** our .blue[Hypothesis] and **answers** our .blue[Research Question]

---

# Conclusion

--

- What we've done today is a microcosm of data science

--

  1. Opened .red[data] (`readRDS`)
  
--
  
  2. Looked at .red[data] (`tidyverse` + `select()`, `filter()`, `arrange()`)
    
--

  3. Generated .blue[hypotheses] (Admissions versus SAT scores)
  
--

  4. .red[Tested] .blue[hypotheses] (`summarise()` + `mean()`)
