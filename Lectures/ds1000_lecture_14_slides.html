# Recap of Movie Analysis


```r

mv &lt;- read_rds('https://github.com/jbisbee1/DS1000_S2024/raw/main/data/mv.Rds')

--

- .blue[Theory]: the more a movie costs, the more it should make

--

  - If not, Hollywood would go out of business!
  
--

- `\(X\)`: budget

- `\(Y\)`: gross

# Step 1: Look

# More Wrangling?

--

- Univariate visualization higlights significant **skew** in both measures

--

  - Most movies don't cost a lot and don't make a lot
  
--

  - But there are a few blockbusters that pull the density way out
  
--

- Let's **wrangle** two new variables that take the log of these skewed measures

--

  - Logging transforms skewed measures to more "normal" measures


```r
mv &lt;- mv %&gt;%
  mutate(gross_log = log(gross),
         budget_log = log(budget))
```

---

# Step 2: Univariate Viz


```r
mv %&gt;%
  select(title,gross_log,budget_log) %&gt;%
  gather(metric,value,-title) %&gt;%
  ggplot(aes(x = value,color = metric)) + 
  geom_density()
```

# Step 3: Multivariate Viz

  ggplot(aes(x = budget,y = gross)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  scale_x_log10(labels = scales::dollar) + 
  scale_y_log10(labels = scales::dollar) + 
  labs(title = "Movie Costs and Returns",
       x = "Costs (logged budget)",
       y = "Returns (logged gross)")
```

---

# Step 3: Multivariate Viz


```r
pClean + geom_smooth(method = 'lm')
```

```
## `geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'
```

&lt;img src="ds1000_lecture_14_slides_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

# Step 4: Regression!

# Step 5.1: Univariate Viz of Errors

  - In `R`, can also get them via `resid()` function

# Thinking like a .blue[scientist]

--

- Our previous model predicted `gross` as a function of `budget`

--

- .blue[Theoretically], is this sensible?

--
    
  1. Bigger budgets &amp;rarr; famous actors &amp;rarr; mass appeal &amp;rarr; more tickets
  
--

  2. Bigger budgets &amp;rarr; advertising money &amp;rarr; mass appeal &amp;rarr; more tickets
  
--

- But what if the movie is just...not good?


---

# Alternative .blue[Theory]

--

- Good movies make more money

--

  - .blue[Theory]: good movies &amp;rarr; recommendations &amp;rarr; more tickets
  
--

- Predict gross with .red[IMDB rating] (`score`)


```r
pIMDB &lt;- mv %&gt;%
  ggplot(aes(x = score,y = gross)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  labs(title = "Movie gross as a function of public perception",
       x = "IMDB score",
       y = "Gross (logged)") + 
  scale_y_log10(label = scales::dollar) + 
  geom_smooth(method = 'lm',se = F)
```

---

# Alternative .red[Model]


```r
pIMDB
```

&lt;img src="ds1000_lecture_14_slides_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-18-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

# Evaluating the Model

--

- Let's go straight to RMSE

--

  - We can have `R` calculate errors for us with `residuals()` command


```r
m2 &lt;- lm(gross_log ~ score,mv)
error &lt;- residuals(m2)
(rmseScore &lt;- sqrt(mean(error^2)))
```

```
## [1] 1.753146
```

--

- Even worse!

---

# Multivariate Regression

--

- Recall that we can **model** our outcome with multiple **predictors**

`$$Y = \alpha + \beta_1 X_1 + \beta_2 X_2 + \dots + \varepsilon$$`

--

- How much better can we predict `gross` with **BOTH** `budget` and `score`?


```r
m3 &lt;- lm(gross_log ~ budget_log + score,mv)
error &lt;- residuals(m3)
(rmseBudgScore &lt;- sqrt(mean(error^2)))
```

```
## [1] 1.248817
```

---

# Comparing Models

--

- Which model best predicts movie revenues?


```r
p &lt;- data.frame(budget = mean(rmseBudget),
           IMDB = rmseScore,
           combined = rmseBudgScore) %&gt;%
  gather(model,rmse) %&gt;%
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(model,rmse),y = rmse)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = 'identity') + 
  labs(title = "Best Regression Model",
       subtitle = "Predicting a movie's revenue",
       y = "RMSE (lower is better)",
       x = "Model") + 
  coord_flip()
```

# Comparing Models

- Which model best predicts movie revenues?


```r
p
```

&lt;img src="ds1000_lecture_14_slides_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-22-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;


---

# Why RMSE?

--

- Want to understand how good / bad our model is

--

- Can use it to compare models

---

# Why RMSE?

- Do we improve our model with `score`?


```r
set.seed(123)
bsRes &lt;- NULL
for(i in 1:100) {
  inds &lt;- sample(1:nrow(mv),size = round(nrow(mv)/2),replace = F)

# Categorical Data

--

- Thus far, only using continuous variables

--

- But we can do regression with categorical data too!

--

- The Bechdel Test: 3 questions of a movie

--

  1. Does it have two women in it?
  2. Who talk to each other?
  3. About something other than a man?
  

```r
mv %&gt;%
  count(bechdel_score)
```

```
## # A tibble: 5 × 2
##   bechdel_score     n
##           &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt;
## 1             0   141
## 2             1   526
## 3             2   206
## 4             3  1185
## 5            NA  1121
```

# Research Question

--

- .blue[Do movies that pass the Bechdel Test make more money?]

--

  - .blue[Theory:] Women are ~50% of the population. Movies that pass the test are more appealing to women.
  
--

  - .blue[Hypothesis:] Movies that pass the test make more money.
  
--

- .red[Wrangling:] Let's turn the `bechdel_score` variable into a binary


```r
mv &lt;- mv %&gt;%
  mutate(bechdel_bin = ifelse(bechdel_score == 3,1,0)) %&gt;%
  mutate(bechdel_factor=recode_factor(bechdel_bin,
                                      `1`="Pass",
                                      `0`="Fail",
                                      ))
```

---

# Regression

--

- We can add the binary factor to our regression


```r
summary(lm(gross_log ~ bechdel_factor,mv))
```

```
## 
## Call:
## lm(formula = gross_log ~ bechdel_factor, data = mv)

# Regression

- Coefficient is positive

--

- What is the interpretation?

--

  - Movies that fail make more money...
  
--

  - ...than what?
  
--

  - Movies that pass the Bechdel Test
  
--

- Categorical variables are **always interpreted in relation to the hold-out category**!

---

# Regression

- Movies that fail the test make more money!?

--

- **REMEMBER**: Correlation `\(\neq\)` causation

--

  - What might explain this pattern?
  
--

  - Budgets in a sexist Hollywood!
  
--

  - Movies that fail the test get larger budgets
  
--

  - Budgets are positively associated with gross
  
--

- So we want to "control" for budget by adding it to our regression

mBechCtrl &lt;- lm(gross_log ~ budget_log + bechdel_factor,mv)

# Categorical

- Everything makes less money than the hold-out category!

--

  - "G"-rated movies are powered by children

- What if we wanted to compare to a different reference category?
