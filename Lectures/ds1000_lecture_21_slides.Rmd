# Agenda

- Ethics

  1. Ethics & .red[data] .blue[science]

--

  2. Ethics & machine learning

--

  - NB: some of this could be triggering (and it is certainly vulgar)
  

  
---

# Why should we focus on ethics?

--

- First, why should anyone?

--

- Second, why should researchers?

--

  - Researchers contribute to **human knowledge**

# Why should we focus on ethics?

- First, why should anyone?

- Second, why should researchers?

  - Researchers contribute to **human knowledge**

  - This is power, and with it comes responsibility
  
--
  
- Third, why should .red[data] .blue[scientists] in particular?

> [J]ust as the invention of the telescope revolutionized the study of the heavens, so too by **rendering the unmeasurable measurable**, the technological revolution in mobile, Web, and Internet communications has the potential to revolutionize our understanding of ourselves and how we interact.

# Readymade Data

- Data generated by human behaviors **without their knowledge**

# Readymade Data

--

- Twitter accounts are public

--

  - If anyone can read this tweet, why can't I study it?

--

  - "They should know better."

# Readymade Data

- Privacy as a human right

--

  1. Right to solitude

  2. Right to intimacy
  
  3. Right to anonymity
  
  4. Right to reserve

- Human capacity vs technological capacity for change

--

- "Should know" is not grounds for an ethical argument

# How is ethics practiced in data science today?

---

# How is ethics practiced in data science today?

- In academia

--

  - Primarily **rules-based** approach
  
--

- Elsewhere

--

  - **Ad hoc** approach
  
--

- Increasing push for a **Principles-based** approach
  
---

# Rules-Based Approach

--

- IRBs + federal law (in the U.S.)

--

- Limitations

--

  - Slow to change
  
  - Hard to explain
  
---

# Ad Hoc Approach

--

- People thinking about ethics independently

--

- Limitations

--
  
  - No community feedback

--

  - Hard to do!

---

# Principles-Based Approach

--

- Implicit in both **rules-based** and **ad hoc** approaches

--

- Puts the principles first

--

  - Principles developed by ethics community
  
---

# Principles-Based Approach

--

1. Respect for persons

--

  - People's autonomy should be respected

--

2. Beneficence

--

  - Define / measure costs and benefits
  
--

  - Evaluate whether benefits outweight costs

--

3. Justice

--

  - Distribution of costs and benefits

--

4. Respect for Law & Public Interest

--

  - Compliance with laws, terms of service
  
--

  - Transparency about methods, procedures to ensure accountability
  
---

# Principles-Based Approach

--

- In practice, ensuring all 4 principles is **very difficult**

--

  - I.e., sharing replication materials creates tension between #4 (transparency) and #1 & #2 (respect for persons and costs)
  
--

- Ethical Frameworks

--

  1. Deontology (focus on means)
  2. Consequentialism (focus on ends)

--

<center><img src="figs/ethics_framework.png" width="100%"></center>

---

# The Importance of Explanation

--

- Balancing principles with Ethical Frameworks requires explanation

--

  - Elicits feedback &rarr; new **perspectives**
  
--

  - Consistent with Principle #4: transparency & accountability
  
--

- Prevents **dogmatism** & **extremism**

--

  - Extreme consequentialism: organ donor example
  
--

  - Extreme deontology: public safety example

---

# Reflection

- All semester: state your assumptions

--

- This is **reflection**

--

  - **Why** do you think the way you do?
  
--

- **Reflection** is the hearth of morality

--

  - Think about the *questions* you **ask**, the *goals* you seek to **achieve**, and the *methods* you **use** to do so

# Thank you!
