# Social Media

- For researchers, social media is two things

--

  1. A source of .red[data]
  
--

  2. An object of .blue[interest]

# Twitter as Data

- Not the most popular social media app

&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/04/PI_2021.04.07_social-media_0-01.png?w=640" width="60%"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

# Twitter as Data

- But an outsized platform for the elite

--

- As of 2020

--

  - every U.S. governor had a Twitter account
  
--

  - 49 had a Facebook account
  
--

  - 44 had an Instagram account

--

  - 44 had a YouTube account
  
--

- In professional networks, particularly media, Twitter is almost *lingua franca*

---

# Twitter as Data

- Today?

--

&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Twitter has had a massive drop in revenue, due to activist groups pressuring advertisers, even though nothing has changed with content moderation and we did everything we could to appease the activists.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Extremely messed up! They’re trying to destroy free speech in America.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Elon Musk (@elonmusk) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1588538640401018880?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 4, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

# Trump and Twitter

- Today, looking at Trump's tweets

--

  - Treating it as a .red[data source]
  
--

  - What can his tweets tell us about the man?
  

```r
require(tidyverse)
tweets &lt;- read_rds(file="https://github.com/jbisbee1/DS1000_F2024/raw/main/data/Trumptweets.Rds")
```

--

- The **process**

--

  - Univariate visualisation: how often does he tweet?
  
--


```r
p &lt;- tweets %&gt;% 
  count(Tweeting.date) %&gt;%
  ggplot() +
  geom_point(aes(x=Tweeting.date,y=n),alpha=.4) +
  scale_x_date(date_breaks = 'years',date_labels = '%Y') + 
  labs(x="Date",y="Number of Tweets",title="Tweeting by Trump")
```

# Trump and Twitter

- Research questions abound!

--

1. What happened in...
  
  - June of 2011?
    
  - June of 2012?
    
  - November of 2016? (duh)
    
--

2. Overtime increase during presidency?

--

3. Others?

# Looking at content

- Or we can look at statistical summaries of Trump's tweets

--

  1. Tweets as .red[data]: we can understand him better
  
  2. Tweets as .blue[object of interest]: how do his tweets influence public discourse?
  
--

- We will be using pre-processed tweets

--

  - Lots of **data wrangling** went into this
  
  - See the `prepping_raw_tweets.R` file for more details

--


```r
tweet_words &lt;- read_rds(file="https://github.com/jbisbee1/DS1000_F2024/raw/main/data/Trump_tweet_words.Rds")
```

---

# NLP Definitions

- Before we dig in, some important definitions

--
  
1. **Word / Term:** The core unit of interest

--

  - Often pre-processed to remove "stop words" and to "stem" the words
  
  - "Stop word": an uninteresting, commonly used word
  
  - "Stem / Lemmatize": the core component of a word that contains its meaning (eat, ate, eaten &amp;rarr; eat)
  
--
  
2. **Document:** A collection of words with a single purpose / idea (i.e., a tweet, an essay)

--
  
3. **Corpus:** A collection of documents

--

4. **BOW:** Bag-of-words. Convert a **document** into a count of how many times **words** appear

--

5. **DTM:** Document-term matrix. A dataset where rows are **documents**, columns are **words**, and the values are the counts from **BOW**


---

# What does Trump tweet about?

- Core idea: word frequencies can help:

--

  - Help us understand **documents**
  
--

  - Which help us understand **authors**

# Document Term Matrix

- "DTM" counts all the words in each document

```r

```

## $ n        &lt;int&gt; 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1,…
```

# Document Term Matrix

- However, each tweet is very short

--

- Let's consider the `Tweeting.date` the document

--

  - Concept: What is Trump tweeting about on a given day?
  

```r
dtm &lt;- tweet_words %&gt;%
  count(Tweeting.date,word) %&gt;%
  group_by(word) %&gt;%
  mutate(tot_n = sum(n)) %&gt;% # Also calculate TOTAL number of times a word appears
  ungroup()
```

---

# Wrangle

- Extremely rare words should be dropped (typos, etc.)


```r
dtm %&gt;%
  arrange(tot_n) %&gt;% head() # Trump tweeted "barnesandnoblecom" only once in his life
```

```
## # A tibble: 6 × 4

# Analyzing BOW

- Some words are frequently found in many documents

--

- We want to find words that are **uniquely** used

--

  - "Unique" &amp;rarr; used frequently in one document but not in any others
  
--

- "TF-IDF": Term frequency-inverse document frequency

--

- "TF": `\(\frac{\text{word count}}{\text{total words}}\)`

- "DF": `\(\frac{\text{documents with word}}{\text{total documents}}\)`

--

  - "IDF": Just invert it `\(\frac{\text{total documents}}{\text{documents with word}}\)`
  
$$tf-idf(w,d) = tf(w,d) \times log \left( \frac{N}{df(w)}\right) $$

---

# TF-IDF


```r
require(tidytext) # Required to calculate TF-IDF
dtm.tfidf &lt;- bind_tf_idf(tbl = dtm, term = word, document = Tweeting.date, n = n) # Calculate TF-IDF
dtm.tfidf  %&gt;%
  select(word,tf_idf) %&gt;%
  distinct() %&gt;%
  arrange(-tf_idf) %&gt;%
  slice(1:10)

# `\(K\)`-means

- How to summarize this? `\(k\)`-means clustering!

--

- Recall that `kmeans()` function clusters over every column in a data frame

--

- `dtm.tfidf` is organized "long" (i.e., each row is a word-by-document)

--

- Want to convert to "wide" (i.e., rows are documents, columns are words)

--

- Previously used `spread()`, but for *k*-means with text: `cast_dtm()`

--


```r
castdtm &lt;- cast_dtm(data = dtm.tfidf, document = Tweeting.date, term = word, value = tf_idf)
```

--

- Now let's calculate `kmeans()` (this will take a few seconds)


```r
set.seed(42)
km_out &lt;- kmeans(castdtm, 
                 centers = 50, # Number of "topics"
                 nstart = 5)
```

---

# Looking at Clusters

- Some quick wrangling


```r
require(tidymodels)
km_out_tidy &lt;- tidy(km_out) %&gt;%
  gather(word,mean_tfidf,-size,-cluster,-withinss) %&gt;% # Convert to long data
  mutate(mean_tfidf = as.numeric(mean_tfidf)) # Calculate average TF-IDF
km_out_tidy
```

```
## # A tibble: 158,850 × 5
##     size withinss cluster word  mean_tfidf

# Conclusion

- `\(k\)`-means clustering on text &amp;rarr; **topics**

--

- As always, this is a deep area of study

--

  - Superior methods are out there (Latent Dirichlet Allocation, Structural Topic Modeling, etc.)
  
--

- NOTE: even with text, always start with simple descriptives

--

  - **Looking** at your data is the heart of data science
