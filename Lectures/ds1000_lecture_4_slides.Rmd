# Agenda

1. Recap of last lecture

--

  - Using packages: `install.packages()` & `require()`
  
  - Loading and manipulating data: `readRDS()` and `%>%`
  
--

2. Plotting in `R`

--

  - `ggplot` (`+` instead of `%>%`)

---

# Loading Packages & Data

--

- Create an `.Rmd` file and save to your `code` folder

--

  - Accept defaults, Save As... (with a good name), then `knit`

--

- Load the `tidyverse` package

```{r,message=F,warning=F}
require(tidyverse)
```

--

- Load the data from the course [github page](https://github.com/jbisbee1/DS1000_F2024/raw/main/data/sc_debt.Rds) directly using `read_rds()`

--

  - We **create** an "object" to store the data using a left-arrow: `<-`

--

```{r}
df<-read_rds("https://github.com/jbisbee1/DS1000_F2024/raw/main/data/sc_debt.Rds") 
```

# The Two Camps

<center><img src="figs/camps3.png" width="80%"></center>


---

# The .blue[Research] Camp

- .blue[RQ]: How might admissions and SAT scores be **related**?

--

  - .blue[Theory]: selective schools have stricter criteria
  
--

  - .blue[Hypothesis]: admissions and SAT scores should be **negatively** related
  
--

- How can we test this hypothesis?

---

# Previously: `summarise()`

--

- We can combine base `R` functions with `tidyverse` functions!

--

  - Base `R`: `mean()`
  
  - `tidyverse`: `summarise()` (aka `summarize()`)
  
--
  
- Overall average SAT scores

```{r}
df %>%
  summarise(mean_sat = mean(sat_avg,na.rm=T))
```

---

# Previously: `summarise()`

--

- Let's unpack this

```{r,eval=F}
df %>%
  summarise(mean_sat = mean(sat_avg,na.rm=T))
```

--

  - Create new variable `mean_sat` that contains the `mean()` of every school's average SAT score
  
--

  - `na.rm=T` means we want to ignore missing data. If not?
  
--
  
```{r,eval=T}
df %>%
  summarise(mean_sat = mean(sat_avg))
```

---

#`summarise()` + `filter()`

--

- Recall we want see if more selective schools have higher SAT scores

--

```{r,eval=T}
df %>%
  filter(adm_rate < .1) %>%
  summarise(mean_sat_LT10 = mean(sat_avg,na.rm=T))
```

```{r,eval=T}
df %>%
  filter(adm_rate > .1 & adm_rate < .2) %>%
  summarise(mean_sat_1020 = mean(sat_avg,na.rm=T))
```

---

# `summarise()` + `group_by()`

--

- One final `tidyverse` function: `group_by()`

--

```{r,eval=T}
df %>%
  group_by(selective) %>%
  summarise(mean_sat = mean(sat_avg,na.rm=T))
```


---

# Plotting data

--

- Let's plot the data instead of writing many of these `summarise()` functions

--

- Visualization in `R` uses `ggplot()` function

--

  - Inputs: `aes(x,y,...)` (elipses `...` indicates many more inputs)
  
  - `x` is the x-axis (horizontal)
  
  - `y` is the y-axis (vertical)
  

---

# `ggplot()`

- Attach `ggplot()` to your data with `%>%`

```{r}
df %>% #<<
  ggplot()
```

---

# `ggplot()`

- Then tell it what to put in the x-axis and y-axis

--

- What should go on these axes?

--

- .blue[Theory]: Selective schools choose higher scoring students

--

  - Selective schools **explain** higher scores
  
  - Selective schools: **independent variable** / **explanatory variable** / **predictor** / $X$
  
  - Higher scores: **dependent variable** / **outcome variable** / $Y$
  
--

- Selective schools go on the x-axis, SAT scores go on the y-axis

---

# `ggplot()`

```{r}
df %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = adm_rate,y = sat_avg)) #<<
```

---

# `ggplot()`

- This gives us an empty plot

--

- We have the correct variables on the correct axes...

--

- ...but we need to choose how to display them

--

- There are many different `ggplot()` functions to choose from

--

  - `geom_point()` creates one point for each x and y coordinate
  
  - `geom_bar()` creates a barplot
  
  - `geom_histogram()` creates a histogram
  
  - `geom_density()` creates a density plot
  
  - `geom_boxplot()` creates a box-and-whisker plot
  
---

# `ggplot()`

- We **add** a second `ggplot()` function to the first with a plus sign `+`

--

  - **NB:** This is JUST LIKE THE PIPE OPERATOR `%>%` in `tidyverse`!
  
--

- Since `adm_rate` (the x-axis variable) and `sat_avg` (the y-axis variable) are both numeric ("continuous") measures, we will use `geom_point()`

--

  - We will come back to **variable types** and how to visualize them later
  
---

# `ggplot()`

```{r,warning=F}
df %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = adm_rate,y = sat_avg)) + 
  geom_point() #<<
```

---

# Plotting data

--

- Let's unpack this

--

  - `aes(x,y)` sets the basic aesthetics for the plot
  
--

  - `geom_point()` tells `ggplot()` how to visualize those aesthetics
  
--

  - These two parts are linked with the `+`. Similar to...?

--

  - ...the `%>%` in `tidyverse`!

---

# Interpreting the plot

--

- We **hypothesized** that admissions and SAT scores are negatively related

--

  - Is this supported in the data?
  
--

- Let's add a line of best fit with `geom_smooth()`

```{r,eval = F}
df %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = adm_rate,y = sat_avg)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = 'lm',se = F) #<<
```

---

```{r,echo=F,warning=F,message = F}
df %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = adm_rate,y = sat_avg)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = 'lm',se = F)
```


---

# The .blue[Research] Camp

- .blue[RQ]: How might future earnings and SAT scores be **related**?

--

  - .blue[Theory]: SATs measure student ability.
  
  - .blue[Theory]: Student ability is valued by the labor market.
  
  - .blue[Theory]: Firms pay more for students with higher SAT scores.
  
--

  - .blue[Hypothesis]: Earnings and SAT scores should be **positively** related
  
---

# Plotting Quiz

- Which variable goes on the x-axis?

--

  - **SAT scores**
  
--

- Which variable goes on the y-axis?

  - **Earnings**
  
--

- In our theory, SAT scores **cause** earnings

--

- Why might this **not** be the case?

--

  - Spurious 1: SAT scores **and** earnings are caused by student ability
  
  - Spurious 2: SAT scores **and** earnings are caused by socio-economic privilege
  
---

# Let's Plot!

```{r,eval = F}
df %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = sat_avg,y = md_earn_wne_p6)) + # Build axes
  geom_point() +  # Add points
  geom_smooth(method = 'lm',se = F) # Add line of best fit
```

---

# Outliers

- Which schools are furthest from the line?

--

  - These are **outliers**
  
--

  - These schools are the **furthest** from our .blue[theory]

--

```{r}
df %>%
  mutate(out = ifelse(md_earn_wne_p6 > 100000,
                          instnm,  # Value if TRUE
                          NA)) %>% # Value if FALSE
  drop_na(out,sat_avg) %>%
  select(instnm,md_earn_wne_p6,sat_avg)
```

---

# Plotting data

- We can add these as labels!

```{r,eval=F}
df %>%
   mutate(out = ifelse(md_earn_wne_p6 > 100000,
                          instnm,  # Value if TRUE
                          NA)) %>% # Value if FALSE
  ggplot(aes(x = sat_avg,y = md_earn_wne_p6,
             label = out)) + #<<
  geom_point() + 
  geom_text() #<<
```

---

# Plotting data

```{r,echo=F,warning=F}
df %>%
   mutate(out = ifelse(md_earn_wne_p6 > 100000,instnm,NA)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = sat_avg,y = md_earn_wne_p6,label = out)) + 
  geom_point() + geom_text()
```

---

# Plotting data

- Let's accentuate the outlier more with color

```{r}
p <- df %>%
   mutate(out = ifelse(md_earn_wne_p6 > 100000,
                          instnm,  # Value if TRUE
                          NA)) %>% # Value if FALSE
  drop_na(sat_avg) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = sat_avg,y = md_earn_wne_p6,
             label = out,color = out)) + #<<
  geom_point() + 
  scale_color_manual(name = "Outlier",values = c('red','red','black')) + #<<
  geom_text(hjust = .5,vjust = 1,color = 'black',size = 3)
```

---

# Plotting data

```{r,echo=F,warning=F}
p + 
  theme(legend.position = 'none')
```



---

# Categorical Data

- Thus far, plotting two continuous variables with `geom_point()`

--

- What if we wanted to see which state has the most selective schools?

--

- Use `group_by()` and `summarise()`
  
--

```{r}
df %>%
  group_by(stabbr) %>%
  summarise(selective_avg = mean(adm_rate,na.rm=T))
```

---

# Categorical Data

- Two variables (`stabbr` and `selective_avg`), but one of them is now a `character` type

--

- Can we plot this as a scatterplot?

--

```{r}
p <- df %>%
  group_by(stabbr) %>%
  summarise(selective_avg = mean(adm_rate,na.rm=T)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = stabbr,y = selective_avg)) + 
  geom_point()
```

---

# Categorical Data

- Yes...but it isn't very pretty

```{r}
p
```

---

# Categorical Data: `geom_bar()`

- NB: `geom_bar()` will automatically count the values on the x-axis
  
--

```{r}
df %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = stabbr)) + 
  geom_bar()
```

---

# Categorical Data: `geom_bar()`

- This is fine if we just want to know which states have the most schools in our data

--

- But we want to put the average admissions rate on the y-axis instead

--

  - Need to **override** `geom_bar()` default behavior
  
```{r}
p <- df %>%
  group_by(stabbr) %>%
  summarise(selective_avg = mean(adm_rate,na.rm=T)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = stabbr,y = selective_avg)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = 'identity') #<<
```

---

# Categorical Data

```{r}
p
```

---

# Categorical Data

- Getting a little better, but still ugly

--

- Use `reorder()` to sort the x-axis values by the y-axis

```{r}
p <- df %>%
  group_by(stabbr) %>%
  summarise(selective_avg = mean(adm_rate,na.rm=T)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(stabbr,selective_avg),y = selective_avg)) + #<<
  geom_bar(stat = 'identity')
```

---

# Categorical Data

- Even better!

```{r}
p
```

---

# Plot Tweaking

- We could go even further and swap the x and y-axes (although this isn't always a good idea!)

```{r}
p <- df %>%
  group_by(stabbr) %>%
  summarise(selective_avg = mean(adm_rate,na.rm=T)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(y = reorder(stabbr,selective_avg),x = selective_avg)) + #<<
  geom_bar(stat = 'identity')
```

---

# Plot Tweaking

```{r}
p
```

--

- Still ugly though! We want to tweak the labels with `labs()`

---

# Plot Tweaking

```{r}
p + 
  labs(title = "Average Admissions by State",
       x = "Admissions Rate",
       y = "State")
```

---
