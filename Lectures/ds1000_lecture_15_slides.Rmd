# Agenda

1. Classification

2. Fortnite gaming (i.e., Prof's desperate attempt to be relevant)

```{r,message=F,warning=F}

---

# Definitions

- *Classification:* predicting the **class** of given data points via **predictive modeling**

--

  - *Class*: AKA targets, labels, or **categories**
  
--

  - *Predictive Modeling*: Approximate mapping function $f: X \rightarrow Y$
  
--

  - $X$: predictor variables
  
  - $Y$: outcome variable
  
  - $f$: ??
  
---

# Mapping Functions

- We have already used a mapping functions!

--

- Linear Regression

--

  - $f$: $Y = \alpha + \beta X + \varepsilon$
  
--

- Underlying idea: $X$ contain information about $Y$

---

# It is in the $Y$

- If $Y$ is continuous, we use OLS regression

--

- If $Y$ is **binary**, we use "logistic" regression (AKA "logit")

--

  - As always, this is a **deep** area of study for those interested
  
--

- Today, using OLS for binary $Y$

--

  - Next few classes: replacing OLS regression with logit

# Fortnite

- Goal is to win (i.e., be the last player alive)

- Professional e-sports teams want to maximize this probability

- RQ: How can we increase the number of victories?

--

- NB: we are moving out of the **Research** camp now, and into the **Prediction** world

--

  - We don't care so much about *why* a relationship exists, we just want to get accurate predictions

--

  - Theory can still help us, but want to start with the data to get our thinking started

---

# The Data

```{r, message=FALSE}
glimpse(fn)
```

---

# The Data

- Start with the basics:

--

  1. What is the unit of analysis?
  
  2. Which variables are we interested in?


---

# Prediction

$$Y = \alpha + \beta_1 X_1 + \beta_2 X_2 + \dots + \varepsilon$$

--

- $Y$: victory (`won`)

--

- $X$: ??

--

  - In prediction, we don't care about **theory** or **research questions**

  - Just want to maximize **accuracy**...which $X$'s are the "best"?
  
  - But theory can still help us make sensible choices about which $X$'s to use
  
--

- Look at univariate & conditional relationships

---

# The Data

- Outcome $Y$: `won`

```{r,message=F,warning=F}
require(scales)
fn %>%
  summarise(`Win %` = percent(mean(won)))
```

--

- Multivariate analysis?

---

# Which $X$?

```{r}
fn %>%
  group_by(mental_state) %>%
  summarise(pr_win = mean(won))
```

---

# Which $X$?

```{r}
fn %>%
  group_by(gameIdSession) %>%
  summarise(pr_win = mean(won))
```

---

# Which $X$?

```{r}
fn %>%
  group_by(gameIdSession) %>%
  summarise(pr_win = mean(won)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = gameIdSession,
             y = pr_win)) + 
  geom_point()
```

---

# Which $X$?

```{r}
fn %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = hits,y = won)) + 
  geom_point()
```

---

# Which $X$?

```{r}
fn %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = hits,y = won)) + 
  geom_jitter()
```

---

# Heatmaps

- Look at 3-dimensions of data

--

  - Done this before by tweaking `fill`, `color`, or `size`
  
--

- `geom_tile()`: create a heatmap

```{r}
p <- fn %>%
  mutate(accuracy_decile = ntile(hits,n=10)) %>% # Bin hits by decile (10%)
  group_by(accuracy_decile,mental_state) %>% # Calculate average winning by mental state and accuracy
  summarise(pr_win = mean(won),
            .groups = 'drop') %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = factor(mental_state),
             y = factor(accuracy_decile), # Both x and y-axes are factors
             fill = pr_win)) + # Fill by third dimension
  geom_tile() + # Creates rectangles
  scale_fill_gradient(limits = c(0,1)) # Set fill color (can do much more here)
```

---

# Heatmaps

```{r}
p
```

---

# Simplest Predictions

- Remember: regression is just fancier conditional means

```{r}
fn <- fn %>%
  mutate(hits_decile = ntile(hits,n=10)) %>% # Bin hits by decile (10%)
  group_by(hits_decile,mental_state) %>% # Calculate average winning by mental state and accuracy
  mutate(prob_win = mean(won)) %>% # use mutate() instead of summarise() to avoid collapsing the data
  mutate(pred_win = ifelse(prob_win > .5,1,0)) %>% # If the probability is greater than 50-50, predict a win
  ungroup()
```

---

# Simplest Predictions

- Conditional means

```{r}
fn %>%
  group_by(won,pred_win) %>%
  summarise(nGames=n(),.groups = 'drop')
```

--

- How good is this? Think about the underlying goal...we want a model that accurately predicts whether a game is won or not

- The `won` column is the **truth**...it tells us whether the game was won or not

- The `pred_win` column is our **prediction**

---

# Accuracy

- What is "accuracy"?

--

  - Proportion "correct" predictions
  
--

- For a binary outcome, "accuracy" has two dimensions

--

  - Proportion of correct `1`s: **Sensitivity**
  
  - Proportion of correct `0`s: **Specificity**
  
---

# Accuracy

```{r}
(sumTab <- fn %>%
  group_by(won) %>%
  mutate(total_games = n()) %>%
  group_by(won,pred_win,total_games) %>%
  summarise(nGames=n(),.groups = 'drop') %>%
  mutate(prop = nGames / total_games))
```

--

- Overall accuracy: (`r (sumTab %>% filter(won == 0 & pred_win == 0) %>% pull(nGames))`+`r (sumTab %>% filter(won == 1 & pred_win == 1) %>% pull(nGames))`) / (`r (sumTab %>% filter(won == 0 & pred_win == 0) %>% pull(total_games))`+`r (sumTab %>% filter(won == 1 & pred_win == 1) %>% pull(total_games))`) = `r percent(((sumTab %>% filter(won == 0 & pred_win == 0) %>% pull(nGames)) + (sumTab %>% filter(won == 1 & pred_win == 1) %>% pull(nGames))) / ((sumTab %>% filter(won == 0 & pred_win == 0) %>% pull(total_games)) + (sumTab %>% filter(won == 1 & pred_win == 1) %>% pull(total_games))))`

- But we are doing **great** at predicting losses (`r percent(sumTab %>% filter(won == 0 & pred_win == 0) %>% pull(prop))`)...

- ...and **terribly** at predicting wins (`r percent(sumTab %>% filter(won == 1 & pred_win == 1) %>% pull(prop))`)

---

# Regression

```{r,message = F}
fn %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = damage_to_players,y = won)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = 'lm')
```

---

# Regression

- Binary outcome variable!

--

  - A linear regression is not the best solution
  
--

  - Predictions can exceed support of $Y$

--

- But it can still work! **linear probability model**

```{r}
mLM <- lm(won ~ hits + accuracy + mental_state,fn)
```

---

# Linear Regression

```{r}
require(broom) # broom package makes it easy to read regression output
tidy(mLM) %>% # This would be the same as summary(mLM)
  mutate_at(vars(-term),function(x) round(x,5))
```

---

# Linear Regression

```{r}
mLM <- lm(won ~ scale(hits) + scale(accuracy) + mental_state,fn)
tidy(mLM)
fn %>%
  summarise_at(vars(hits,accuracy),function(x) round(sd(x),1))
```

---

# Evaluating Predictions

```{r}
mLM <- lm(won ~ hits + accuracy + mental_state + damage_taken + head_shots + gameIdSession,fn)
fn %>%
  mutate(preds = predict(mLM)) %>%
  mutate(predBinary = ifelse(preds > .5,1,0)) %>%
  select(won,predBinary,preds)
```

---

# Evaluating Predictions


```{r}
(sumTab <- fn %>%
  mutate(pred_win = ifelse(predict(mLM) > .5,1,0)) %>%
  group_by(won) %>%
  mutate(total_games = n()) %>%
  group_by(won,pred_win,total_games) %>%
  summarise(nGames=n(),.groups = 'drop') %>%
  mutate(prop = percent(nGames / total_games)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(accuracy = percent(sum((won == pred_win)*nGames) / sum(nGames))))
```

---

# Evaluating Predictions

- Overall accuracy is just the number of correct predictions (either `0` or `1`) out of all possible

--

  - Is `r sumTab$accuracy[1]` good?

--

  - What would the dumbest guess be? Never win! `r percent(1-mean(fn$won))`

--

- Might also want to care about just `1`s

--

  - **Sensitivity**: Predicted wins / actual wins = `r sumTab %>% filter(won == 1 & pred_win == 1) %>% pull(prop)`
  
--

- Also might care about just `0`s

--

  - **Specificity**: Predicted losses / actual losses = `r sumTab %>% filter(won == 0 & pred_win == 0) %>% pull(prop)`
  
---

# Thresholds

- Shifting the threshold for `0` or `1` prediction can matter

--

```{r}
fn %>%
  mutate(pred_win = ifelse(predict(mLM) > .4,1,0)) %>%
  group_by(won) %>%
  mutate(total_games = n()) %>%
  group_by(won,pred_win,total_games) %>%
  summarise(nGames=n(),.groups = 'drop') %>%
  mutate(prop = percent(nGames / total_games)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(accuracy = percent(sum((won == pred_win)*nGames) / sum(nGames)))
```

---

# Thresholds

- Shifting the threshold for `0` or `1` prediction can matter

```{r}
fn %>%
  mutate(pred_win = ifelse(predict(mLM) > .7,1,0)) %>%
  group_by(won) %>%
  mutate(total_games = n()) %>%
  group_by(won,pred_win,total_games) %>%
  summarise(nGames=n(),.groups = 'drop') %>%
  mutate(prop = percent(nGames / total_games)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(accuracy = percent(sum((won == pred_win)*nGames) / sum(nGames)))
```

- Restricting to above 70% means we don't think anyone wins!

---

# Thresholds

- We could keep trying different values until we hit on one that maximizes our accuracy

--

- But this is inefficient! Let's loop it instead!

--


```{r}
toplot <- NULL
for(thresh in seq(0,1,by = .025)) {
  toplot <- fn %>%
  mutate(pred_win = ifelse(predict(mLM) > thresh,1,0)) %>%
  group_by(won) %>%
  mutate(total_games = n()) %>%
  group_by(won,pred_win,total_games) %>%
  summarise(nGames=n(),.groups = 'drop') %>%
  mutate(prop = nGames / total_games) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(accuracy = sum((won == pred_win)*nGames) / sum(nGames)) %>%
  mutate(threshold = thresh) %>%
    bind_rows(toplot)
}
```

---

# Thresholds

- We might only care about accuracy by itself (although this is a bit naive)

.small[
```{r}
toplot %>%
  select(accuracy,threshold) %>%
  distinct() %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = threshold,y = accuracy)) + 
  geom_line()
```
]

---

# Thresholds

.small[
```{r}
toplot %>%
  mutate(metric = ifelse(won == 1 & pred_win == 1,'Sensitivity',
                         ifelse(won == 0 & pred_win == 0,'Specificity',NA))) %>%
  drop_na(metric) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = threshold,y = prop,color = metric)) + 
  geom_line()
```
]


---

# ROC Curve

- Receiver-Operator Characteristic (ROC) Curve

--

- Commonly used to evaluate classification methods

--

  - X-axis: 1-specificity

  - Y-axis: sensitivity

--

```{r}
p <- toplot %>%
  mutate(metric = ifelse(won == 1 & pred_win == 1,'Sensitivity',
                         ifelse(won == 0 & pred_win == 0,'Specificity',NA))) %>%
  drop_na(metric) %>%
  select(prop,metric,threshold) %>%
  spread(metric,prop) %>%
  arrange(desc(Specificity),Sensitivity) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = 1-Specificity,y = Sensitivity)) + 
  geom_line() + 
  xlim(c(0,1)) + ylim(c(0,1)) + 
  geom_abline(slope = 1,intercept = 0,linetype = 'dotted') + 
  ggridges::theme_ridges()
```

---

# ROC Curve

```{r}
p
```

--

- Better models have high levels of sensitivity **and** specificity at every threshold

---

# AUC Measure

- Area Under the Curve (AUC)

--

  - A single number summarizing classification performance
  
--

```{r,message=F}
require(tidymodels)
roc_auc(data = fn %>%
  mutate(pred_win = predict(mLM),
         truth = factor(won,levels = c('1','0'))) %>%
  select(truth,pred_win),truth,pred_win)
```

---

# AUC

- What is a "good" AUC?

--

  - We know it is bounded between 0 (i.e., it predicts everything **perfectly wrong**) and 1 (i.e., it predicts everything **perfectly correct**)
  
  - But typically we don't see AUC values less than 0.5 (why is this?)
  
--

- AUC can be interpreted like numeric grades at Vandy (and for this class)

  - 0.95+ is amazing
  
  - 0.9 - 0.95 is very good
  
  - 0.8-range is B-tier
  
  - 0.7-range is C-tier
  
  - 0.6-range is really bad
  
  - AUC values less than 0.6 are failing

---

# Party time!

- Adding more variables / trying different combinations

--

- **Workflow**

--

  1. Train models
  
  2. Predict models
  
  3. Evaluate models

m5 <- lm(won ~ hits + accuracy + head_shots + mental_state + distance_traveled,fn)
m6 <- lm(won ~ hits + accuracy + mental_state + head_shots + distance_traveled + gameIdSession,fn)
```

         m4Preds = predict(m4),
         m5Preds = predict(m5),
         m6Preds = predict(m6),
         truth = factor(won,levels = c('1','0')))
```

  rocRes <- roc_auc(toEval,truth,paste0('m',model,'Preds')) %>%
    mutate(model = paste0('Model ',model)) %>%
